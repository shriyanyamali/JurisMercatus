# Verdictr

## Purpose

Verdictr is a market definition database aggregated from the European Commission's merger and antitrust case decisions. It brings all the definitions together on one page and uses natural language searches, so your query doesn't need to exactly match the wording in the decisions.

## Development

The database for Verdictr was created using this repo: [shriyanyamali/market-def-scraper](https://github.com/shriyanyamali/market-def-scraper)

## Live Demo

Try it out in your browser (no sign‑up needed):

## Features

- 4 000+ market definitions
- 600 unique cases
- Natural Language Search
- Free and Open Access

## How to Use

1. Visit the **Search** page to start exploring definitions.
