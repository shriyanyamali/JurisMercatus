    "topic": "Product Market for Supply of Pet Food",
    "text": "In past decisions, the Commission considered that each of the markets for the supply of cat food and dog food could be further segmented: (i) between dry food, wet food and snacks and (ii) between branded products and products for private labels at the wholesale level. However, the Commission considered that different quality categories of pet food were not deemed to form separate relevant product markets. The outcome of the market investigation in the present case confirmed the Commission\u2019s previous decisions. The results of the market investigation confirmed that dry food, wet food and snacks should be considered to belong to different product markets. On the demand side, dry food is less expensive and can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration, while wet food offers higher hydration and palatability particularly for pets with specific health needs or preferences. Snacks are generally used as treats, but do not provide a balanced nutrition and therefore cannot substitute dry or wet food. On the supply side, these products are manufactured on distinct production lines with entirely different technical processes and dedicated packaging. The results of the market investigation also confirmed the relevance of a segmentation between branded product and products for private labels at the wholesale level. On the demand side, these products address clearly distinct use cases for retailers: the formulation and packaging of products for private labels are customized to the specific retailer and are labelled with the retailer\u2019s own brand, while branded products feature the supplier\u2019s own brand and are made available to several retailers in the same format. On the supply side, although the same production lines can in principle be used to produce both branded products and products for private labels, the supply base in these two segments is significantly different. This is because the main suppliers of branded products (such as Mars and Nestl\u00e9) are large, sophisticated conglomerates focusing on the promotion of their own brands and are not active (or no longer active) in the supply of products for private labels. Conversely, producers for private labels are generally smaller in size. And even if some of them also offer a range of branded products, this offering is often rather marginal and in any case much smaller than the abovementioned branded suppliers. With respect to quality categories, the results of market investigation confirmed that, although consumers often have a preference for one or the other quality tier, these different categories exist in a continuum and respondents were not able to indicate clearcut criteria demarcating the boundaries of each segment. Moreover, most suppliers producing pet food of different quality categories do so on the same production lines with no or minor adjustments to the manufacturing process. Therefore, in line with its past decisions, in the present case the Commission assessed market shares for the supply of cat and dog food at wholesale level distinguishing between dry food, wet food and snacks and between branded and private label products."

    "text": "The Commission\u2019s past decisions concluded that the relevant geographic market is national in scope for branded products and larger than national (and possibly EEA-wide) for private label product at the wholesale level. This difference stems from the fact that private label products are not advertised by their supplier, as any advertising for private label products is done by the retailer. Producers may therefore afford higher transport costs and still offer the product at competitive prices compared to the branded pet food. Therefore, manufacturers of private label can competitively sell such products throughout an extensive area, which is wider than national. Moreover, some international hypermarket chains tend to carry out their procurement policies for private label purchases in a context which is wider than national. In the present case, the large majority of responding suppliers indicated that their European plants are able to deliver their branded and private label products in most of the EU territory and even to other continents. The large majority of responding retailers similarly indicated that they are able to procure branded and private label products from producers located in most of the European territory. In any event, the geographic market can be left open, because the transaction does not raise any concerns even under the most conservative approach (i.e. assuming a national scope of the relevant markets)."

    "text": "At the retail level, the Commission\u2019s precedent concluded that products sold through grocery outlets (e.g. supermarkets or convenience stores) and specialist outlets (e.g. pet shops and veterinaries) form an overall market. The market investigation in the present case confirmed this conclusion. From the point of view of the upstream producers (which is particularly relevant in this case), the different distribution channels are seen to a large extent as interchangeable, because producers supply the same products across channels with no or minor adjustments. Suppliers also explained that they are able to shift volumes among different channels in response to changes in market demand. Also from the point of view of downstream consumers, grocery and specialist outlets are seen as competing against each other and consumers often buy products in both channels. The Commission\u2019s precedent (dating back to more than 20 years ago) did not mention sales on online platforms. The market investigation in the present case showed that customers easily switch between online and brick-and-mortar shops and suppliers increasingly pursue omni-channel strategies that span both online and offline sales. The Commission therefore considers that the overall market for the retail of pet food also includes online sales."

These agreements thus provide the legal basis for a global integration of the companies\u2019 networks and commercial policies. Furthermore, the scope of and rationale for these agreements go beyond the bundle of routes between Germany and their respective home countries. Thus, these carriers have little or no incentive to compete post-merger with Swiss. Not only will Swiss become a subsidiary of Lufthansa it will also become a member of the Star Alliance. The market investigation, in particular replies from travel agents and corporate customers, confirms this conclusion\u2019."

The Parties submit that there is a distinct product market for MCC, which could potentially be further segmented by industry application. The Parties however submit that a distinction between MCC for pharmaceutical applications and MCC for nutraceutical applications would not be appropriate.

According to the majority of both customers and suppliers MCC is not, or only to a limited extent substitutable for other excipients (such as lactose), as MCC has unique chemical properties and substitutes such as lactose are often not substitutes as there is a trend to providing lactose-free formulas. The market investigation also indicates that there may be a segmentation between MCC for pharmaceutical and MCC for nutraceutical applications. On the one hand, MCC for pharmaceuticals may have a price premium that makes it uneconomical to use it in nutraceuticals. On the other hand, MCC for nutraceuticals can only be used in pharmaceuticals if it complies with a pharmacopoeia such as the European pharmacopoeia. While the production process for both types of MCC is similar, there is a stronger emphasis on quality control and consistent quality for MCC for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, there may be limited substitutability between MCC for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, but the results of the market investigation are not entirely conclusive on this point, as the production process for all types of MCC is similar and there is an overlap of certain grades being used for both applications, which speaks in favour of not segmenting the market by end-application."

The results of the market investigation generally support a further segmentation of the HVAC market based on type of technology, as a starting point. Further, the market investigation supports a possible further segmentation of the FCU market according to: (i) intended use (i.e., residential vs non-residential FCUs), (ii) based on the number of tubes (i.e., FCUs with two tubes and FCUs with four tubes) and (iii) design (i.e. classical FCUs that are free standing on the floor and non-classical FCUs that are mounted in the wall or ceiling). The majority of respondents to the market investigation indicated that a segmentation of FCUs between those for residential and those for non-residential use would be appropriate, and one customer noted that \u2018This is the main distinction relevant.\u2019 The views of market participants, however, varied as to which criteria should be used to differentiate between residential and non-residential FCUs. Size and capacity of FCUs are the most cited distinguishing factors, with residential FCUs normally being smaller in size and having a lower heating/cooling capacity than non-residential FCUs. In terms of capacity, some respondent suggested that residential FCUs could be < 8kW and non-residential FCUs > 8kW. It was also mentioned that FCUs for residential use are \u2018quieter\u2019, \u2018thinner\u2019 and with better aesthetics (having excellent finishes and being made by metal sheets rather than plastic). Internal documents of the Parties appear to support a segmentation based on intended use. In addition, a due diligence report refers to a \u2018residential ventilation segment\u2019.

The majority of competitors also indicated that there are no regulatory differences preventing the supply of FCUs across the EEA. At the same time, however, the vast majority of competitors indicated that they need a local presence (a local distributor, installer or representative) to make sales in a given country. More precisely, they explained that: \u201cYou need to engage directly with the end user or his mechanical contractor to understand their need and requirements in order to generate a tailored-made quote\u201d; \u201cthe local presence is mandatory to supply FCU\u201d; \u201cYes, need local sales representatives\u201d; \u201cYes, local representation is critical to provide pre and after sales support and logistic operations\u201d; \u201c[\u2026] in each of these Markets it is fundamental to master a solid network of distributors and various contractors (installers, service technicians, planners)[\u2026]\u201d.

One competitor notes that: \u2018Customer priority is cost/quality point and security of solid aftersales service. If these are met at [the] same level, locality could be the next decision point for [a] customer.\u2019 The majority of customers indicated that their contracts to purchase FCUs cover individual countries and a great majority indicated that FCU prices are determined nationally, although some customers indicated that they do purchase FCUs at EEA level or worldwide. While some customers do not see obstacles that could prevent them from sourcing FCUs across the EEA, a comparable number of customers indicated that transportation costs, local standards and certifications could be an obstacle to source FCUs from other countries. One customer indicated that \u201cThe distribution of a technical product like FCU is depending also of the customer service after sale. Not all suppliers can guarantee this, so they can\u00b4t sell their products everywhere.\u201d  The exact geographic market definition for the market for FCUs can be left open since no competition concerns arise as a result of the Transaction under any of the alternative geographic market definitions (i.e. national, or EEA-wide)."

    "text": "The Commission has previously found that the market for the production and supply of non-alcoholic beverages was further segmented into the production and supply of carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated soft drinks, which were found to constitute two separate product markets. Within non-carbonated soft drinks, the Commission has considered that water and ready-to-drink teas belong to separate product markets. The Commission has considered further potential segmentations within non-carbonated soft drinks (namely fruit juices, energy and sport drinks), but has ultimately left this question open. In particular, the Commission left open the question of whether dilutables (e.g. squashes and syrups) compete with other soft drinks. In the present case, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition can be left open. If dilutables were part of the wider market of soft drink (either carbonated or not, depending on the beverage mixed with the dilutable), no affected markets would arise in relation to these products. If dilutables were part of a separate market, that market would be vertically affected but \u2013 for the reasons explained in the following sections \u2013 the Transaction would not raise competition concerns."

    "text": "The relevant product market comprises scheduled passenger air transport services. The analysis focuses on city-pair markets for flights to and from London Heathrow airport (\"Heathrow\"), which is recognised as a highly slot-constrained airport. The Commission\u2019s assessment concentrates on the routes identified within the Commitments, specifically including London -Aberdeen, London -Edinburgh, London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow. The Commitments distinguish between \"Identified UK City Pairs\" (London -Aberdeen and London -Edinburgh) and broader \"Identified City Pairs\" (the latter including the UK pairs as well as London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow). The geographic market is primarily defined narrowly, as flights operating to and from Heathrow only. This focus arises from the congestion and slot constraints at Heathrow, which is the central concern addressed by the Commitments. An analysis of wider markets, including London \"three\" (Heathrow, Gatwick, City) and London \"five\" airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, City, Luton, Stansted), was considered. However, the Commission\u2019s decision and remedies are aimed at addressing competition effects specifically at Heathrow, as highlighted in recital 58 of the Decision and in line with precedent decisions. The term \"London -Moscow\" is interpreted within the scope of the Commitments as Heathrow -Moscow, not encompassing Gatwick. While Gatwick services exist, they were not part of the competition concerns at the time of adoption of the Decision, and hence do not affect the scope of the committed slot releases. The Market Definition section therefore recognizes the relevant markets as scheduled passenger air transport services on the specified city-pairs operating out of Heathrow airport, on which the competitive dynamics and remedies are focused."

Consequently, for the purposes of the analysis of this Transaction, the Commission considered the relevant markets for the provision of passenger cruise services on a national basis."

    "topic": "CRM Software Functionality of Customer Service and Support",
    "text": "With respect of a possible distinction of CRM software solutions based on functionality , the market investigation indicated that there may be  a separate market for the CRM software functionality of customer service and support, whic h also corresponds to a distinction used by Kustomer itself, as well as in third party reports, such as Gartner. From a demand -side perspective, a strong majority of responding market participants (both CRM software providers and business customers) cons idered that CRM software with different functionalities are complementary rather than substitutable and that customer service and support CRM software is the only type of CRM software functionality that is substitutable for Kustomer\u2019s CRM software product . The majority of CRM providers that expressed a view considered it would not be technically possible (or at best only to a limited extent), nor would it be likely from a commercial perspective, for business customers to switch to other CRM software funct ionalities (i.e., other than customer service and support CRM software) in a scenario where the price of customer service and support CRM software increased. From a supply -side perspective, while larger CRM software providers may offer a range of differen t functionalities, smaller players (such as Kustomer) may only offer one or a limited number of functionalities. There was no clear consensus among CRM providers on the ability for a company specialised in other functionalities to start offering customer s ervice and support CRM software in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs . While in the Phase I market investigation, a  majority of respondents that expressed a view said that this  would not be possible in the short term and with out incurring significant investment costs, in the Phase II market investigation, the results were mixed, with several respondents indicating that it would depend on the CRM software provider\u2019s existing capabilities (e.g., existing technology and know -how). In light of the above , the Commission  concludes that, from a demand side perspective, there is a separate market for customer service and support CRM software. To the extent the market would be  wider than customer service and support CRM software, this would thus only be due to supply -side substitutability arguments (i.e., a CRM software provider offering another functionality starting to offer customer service and support CRM software). However , the Commission considers that any CRM software provider active in another segment wanting to start offering customer service and support CRM software would require B2C communication channels as an input, as customer service and support CRM by definition requires interaction with customers, and that the mere fact that some CRM software providers offer multiple functionalities does not establish full supply -side substitutability if starting to offer a different functionality cannot necessarily be done in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs."

    "text": "As regards a possible distinction depending on the mode of deployment, namely cloud- based/SaaS or on- premises, the results of the market investigation were mixed from a demand side perspective. There was no consensus between business customers that expressed a view on whether on- premises and cloud- based CRM software solutions are substitutable for one another. From a supply -side perspective, the majority of respondents that expressed a view considered that it would not be possible for a CRM software provider specialised in on -premises solutions to start offering cloud- based CRM solutions in the shor t term and without incurring significant investment costs. However, the market investigation also indicated that a majority of CRM software customers use cloud- based solutions, and most CRM software providers only or primarily offer cloud- based solutions. One market participant indicated that \u201c companies that specialized in on- premise s solutions have or are moving towards offering cloud- based solutions \u201d and a leading CRM software provider  confirmed that it \u201c offers only cloud- based solutions .\u201d The same is  true of Kustomer. Indeed, the majority of respondents that expressed a view also indicated that cloud -based CRM software solutions are either progressively replacing on- premises solutions, or have almost entirely done so. In light of the mixed market inv estigation results and the fact that the majority of the market already appears to be cloud -based/SaaS, the Commission considers that it is not necessary to segment the broader CRM software market or the narrower customer service and support CRM software m arket between SaaS/cloud based solutions on the one hand and on- premises solutions on the other hand. However, the precise segmentation can be left open as the Commission  considers that it is likely, and there is even a strong probability, that the  Transaction would significantly impede effective competition  in both an overall market for customer service and support CRM software and a potential segment for cloud- based customer service and support CRM software solutions (as well as on the broader CRM software solutions  market  and a potential segment for cloud- based CRM software solutions)."

First, while both type of services are used for the same purpose, consumer communication apps are richer in terms of functionalities (e.g., seeing when another user was last online, whether another user is typing etc.). Second, there is a difference in pricing conditions as consumer communications apps are mainly offered for free. Third, telecoms operators responding to the market investigation indicated that the competitive interaction between traditional services and consumer communications apps is only one-way (i.e., consumer communications apps constrain electronic communication services but not the other way around).

Furthermore, according to the data provided by the Parties, there seems to be a large price difference between built-in and freestanding MDA.

Another customer explained that the substitutability might also depend on the specific MDA category: \u201cbuilt-in and freestanding MDA can be substitutable from the consumer\u2019s perspective depending on the price and the MDA category (especially washing machines, dryers and refrigerators).

For example, the Target\u2019s production plants serve the whole EEA from Italy, Poland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom.

Furthermore, market participants have generally confirmed that prices for MDA are negotiated and set at national level . As one market participant explained, \u201c[w]e have separate agreements for each country. Suppliers have separate organisation in each country \u201d. The fact that these negotiations take place at a national level is fully reflected by the fact that there exist significant price differences between EEA countries . Internal data from the Parties show significant price variations among EEA countries, for similar MDA models. For example, for washing machines, internal data from the Target shows that prices among EEA countries can vary as much as [\u2026]% from the average price .

Thirdly, the market investigation has revealed (i) the importance of brands for the purchasing patterns of final customers and (ii) that brands have varying importance from country to country. For example, one market participant highlighted: \u201cMDA are long-lasting products (i.e., a life cycle of 10-20 years for MDA) and customers thus tend to turn more to brands which they know and trust \u201d. Furthermore, brand positioning is not homogeneous from country to country. Some brands have a higher positioning in some countries, while being much less important in other countries. This can be due, for example, to \u201clegacy\u201d brand image. One customer stated the following: \u201c brands in the MDA sector are fundamental, some brands are historical \u201d.

In particular , it considered that Sweden was a relevant geographic market, but ultimately left the market definition open. The Commission found,  in particular , that the geographic area serviced by an individual stockholding depot is determined by transport costs and delivery times. It also found that the value added by steel distribution operations is comparatively low, so that transport costs are an important constr aint on the ability of a distribution operation to compete over long distances .

Indeed, the majority of respondents considered that is not economically rational to switch from active to passive services or from passive to active. The respondents set out that it could only be viable if the operator has its own passive network close to the area where it uses active services and at the same time, it could serve/reach a certain level of customer density and access to passive services would be available. Moreover, some participants mentioned high switching costs , especially in case of migrating between wholesale service providers (e.g. de-activation and activation fees) and time needed for network deployment on the part of the access seeker (indicated to be from several months to more than a year). Hence, most participants signalled that in most cases, it is very difficult to replicate the active services by purchasing passive ones."

    "text": "Reciprocally, the majority of respondents thinks that even if in theory, the wholesale passive broadband access services could be substituted with active ones, it is neither economically rational nor desirable. The respondents highlight that operators would lose their investment (capex) in own active equipment as the sunk costs would not be recovered when using wholesale active access services instead. Furthermore, in such a case, the operators would face higher operational costs (opex) of active services as well as losing a possibility to differentiate more their services from that of the wholesale service provider as in case of using passive access services with own active equipment. In essence, it would go against the principle of the \u201cladder of investment\u201d. In addition, most market participants suggest there are regulatory differences between access to active and passive services. For example, the respondents state that at the time of their reply, there was no access obligation for TIM to provide FTTH passive wholesale access products (except in PNRR areas), while there was an access obligation to provide active services and those services were subject to cost orientation regulation."

    "text": "The outcome of the market investigation suggests that there is a separate product market for the manufacture of lactase distinct from other dairy enzymes. The market investigation strongly supports that there is no demand side substitutability between lactase and other enzymes as the large majority of responding customers and of competitors consider that it is not possible to substitute lactase with another enzyme. As explained by a respondent: \u201cenzymatic activities are highly specific and unique to a substrate. Lactases specifically convert Lactose to Galactose and Glucose, on this basis the same enzymatic process could not be achieved using an alternative enzyme\u201d.\nThat is supported by a number of elements indicating limited supply side substitutability. In order to produce lactase, a manufacturer needs to have the relevant technology (a lactase enzyme and production host), the manufacturing capacities, distribution network and regulatory approvals required to manufacture and commercialise the product.\nAs a result, a majority of responding competitors and distributors consider it would take more than 2 years for a company already active in the manufacture of food and beverage enzymes to start producing and commercially supplying GM produced lactase and an investment \u201c between 10-50 million EUR if the company also has to build infrastructure and team; less than 10 million EUR if the company already has such resources \u201d. In all likelihood, given the similarities in the manufacturing process, similar investments would be necessary to start producing and commercially supplying non-GM produced lactase.\nAs a result, the Parties\u2019 argument on supply side substitution are only applicable to players that already have all the relevant technology, infrastructure, and approvals. Given the above, the Commission considers that there is a separate market for the manufacture of lactase."

Selection is most frequently driven by regulatory requirements to comply with organic certification, or company policy related to the use of GM derived ingredients/process aids \u201d.\nAccordingly, there are two types of lactase customers:\nCustomers bound to use non-GM produced lactase because they need a certain certification; for these customers, the Commission considers that there could be a market for non-GM produced lactase only. As the Parties do not overlap for non-GM produced lactase, this potential market is not considered further.\nCustomers that can use both GM produced and non-GM produced lactase interchangeably.\nThe Commission\u2019s investigation revealed that while this second group of customers can technically use either non-GM or GM produced lactase, there are indications that non-GM places a limited competitive constraint on GM."

Beyond that range, performance varies \u201d. A customer adds that : \u201cdespite their differences, you can compensate a low level of activity of a certain lactase by increasing the quantity used. However, using a higher quantity can impact the taste and texture of the product as well as the overall price \u201d.\nThis is supported by submissions of the Parties on the activity profile of various lactases at different temperatures and pH levels that show that the activity level indeed varies between lactases, with some performing better than others at a given temperature or pH. However, as confirmed by the Parties, that can be compensated by increasing the dosage of lactase used.\nOn this basis, the Commission considers that, with regard to end use, this is a market of heterogeneous products for which it is not appropriate to segment the market for lactase according to end use or performance level in different pH or temperature levels."

    "topic": "Animal pharmaceuticals product market definition",
    "text": "In previous cases in this sector, the Commission has divided animal health products into three main categories: (i) biologicals (such as vaccines), (ii) pharmaceuticals, and (iii) feed supplements.\nIn the present case, the Parties\u2019 activities give rise to affected markets only with respect to marketed animal pharmaceuticals. Animal pharmaceuticals encompass a wide group of products that contain a variety of active substances to prevent or treat a large range of animal diseases and disorders. Within pharmaceuticals, the Commission has distinguished between pharmaceuticals across various therapeutic areas, in particular it has distinguished between parasiticides, otitis products, antimicrobials, endocrine treatments, anti -inflammatories, and analgesics.\nThe Commission has also conducted separate assessments for food production animals (\u201cPA\u201d, i.e. swine, poultry, bovine) and companion animals (\u201cCA\u201d, mostly cats and dogs).\nIn addition, when defining relevant product markets in the area of animal pharmaceuticals, the Commission considered on a case -by-case basis the following factors as important as they might lead to separate markets : (i) species (e.g. cats and dogs within CA; poultry, swine and cattle within PA, equine ), (ii) active ingredient/chemical class, (iii) targeted pathology/indication, (iv) mode of administration (\u201cMoA\u201d) (e.g. oral, topical, injection), (v) duration of efficacy for PA; and (vi) duration of the withdrawal period for PA. Not each factor was considered for each type of pharmaceuticals.\nThe market investigation has confirmed the Commission\u2019s decisional practice with respect to the product market definition of animal pharmaceuticals.\nIn particular, the vast majority of market participants responding to the market investigation agreed that: (i) animal pharmaceuticals form a product market distinct from animal biologicals and feed supplements, (ii) animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by different animal groups (CA, PA and possibly equine), and that animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by therapeutic areas.\nHowever, within a specific therapeutic area, various animal pharmaceuticals are not generally considered substitutable, as they are used for treatment of different indications. A veterinary pharmaceutical intended for a specific indication generally cannot be used for treatment of a different indication. For example, a Dechra product used for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s disease would not be substitutable with a treatment for Addison\u2019s disease even though both treatments belong to the field of endocrinology. Therefore, there is not always demand -side substitution for the various pharmaceuticals within a given therapeutic area.\nIn addition, market participants confirm that players active in an individual therapeutic area typically do not offer an entire portfolio of products in that area , and thus the competitive landscape for different indications even within a therapeutic area can differ considerably. Supply -side substitution is thus not immediate between various pharmaceuticals belonging to a given therapeutic area.\nIn view of the above, for the purposes of this decision, the Commission considers it appropriate with respect to the assessment of vertical links between the Parties, to use the markets for animal pharmaceuticals across therapeutic areas as a starting point for the identification of affected markets but has based the more detailed assessment on the upstream markets for animal pharmaceuticals for each individual indication and/or for a specific animal group. Further differences between animal pharmaceuticals for a specific indication or animal group (which have an influence on the pool of available alternatives) based on the factors identified in paragraph (15) above, are taken into account in the Commission\u2019s competitive assessment."

    "topic": "Veterinary clinics geographic market definition",
    "text": "The Commission has not in the past assessed the geographic delineation of the market for the provision of veterinary clinics. In a previous case, while not defining such a market, the Commission recognised that the retail of dietetic pet food via the veterinary channel could be national in scope or even local.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest that the geographic scope for the provision of veterinary services could be defined as local if the closeness of competition between providers of veterinary services were to be examined. It, however, notes that for the purposes of the Transaction, its effects should be assessed at a national level for veterinary services. This is because the Transaction gives rise to a vertical link between Dechra and IVCE, where the former predominantly distributes its pharmaceuticals through national wholesalers. The Notifying Party therefore does not believe it is appropriate to assess the Transaction based on a narrower geographic delineation.\nThe market investigation suggests that the provision of veterinary services could be either national in scope or local, depending on the type of clinic. As regards primary care clinics, most respondents to the market investigation considered that an animal owner would be willing to travel a distance of maximum 20km. As regards referral clinics, nearly all of the respondents consider that animal owners would travel at least around 50km to a referral clinics, with most of them suggesting that animal owners would travel above 200km. Some market participants explain for exa mple: \u201cFor more advanced procedures carried out in referral clinics, [\u2026], customers might travel across all of Finland for one specific clinic\u201d, and \u201cwhen a referral takes places, the pet owners are willing to travel very far to see the specialist (this could include long distances by car, and even taking flights)\u201d.\nGiven that the Transaction gives rise to vertical links only, and that the procurement of animal pharmaceuticals is in general managed by distributors and clinics on a national basis . This is supported by the fact that a majority of respondents to the market investigation considered that clinics generally have a purchasing strategy at national level, and even, bigger chains tend to have a multi -national / EEA -wide purchasing strategy with national components. Therefore, Dechra, or any animal pharmaceutical company, when dealing with veterinary clinics in a specific country, would typically negotiate the agreement with a centralised (at least) national procurement function of a specific clinic or groups of clinics. Therefore, any attempt of foreclosure strategy of the Merged Entity, i.e. preventing or worsening access to Dechra\u2019s pharmaceuticals, would have to be conducted on a national level. As a result, for the purposes of the vertical assessment in this case, the Commission considers it appropriate to carry out its assessment at a national level."

The Commission found that, while these services are broadly similar to those conducted on a national basis, they entail a higher level of complexity when offered on a multi -country basis . Ultimately, however, the Commission left the exact product market definition open.\nAccording to the Notifying Party, the only core differences between multi -country agreements and one -country agreements pertain to the geographic scope of these agreements and certain customers that request a degree of data harmonisation across the different countries that are covered by a multi -country agreement. Beyond that, each service offered in a multi- country agreement can be and is offered by the Parties in one -country agreements."

This is for the following reasons.\nFirst, on the supply- side, suppliers of RMS, CPS and CMR differ across Member States, while no supplier is active in all EEA Member States.\nAs regards FMCG RMS , NIQ is active in 24 Member States, in 5 of which it is the sole provider. In the Netherlands NIQ faces competition only from Circana, while in 9 Member States NIQ faces competition only from IQVIA. In France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain NIQ, Circana and IQVIA are active. NIQ faces competition from additional, smaller FMCG RMS providers, such as CMR and Retail Zoom, in Poland, Romania and Slovakia. In addition, FMCG RMS providers who are active across multiple Member States do not have the same rate of success across those Member States. For instance, Circana is the market leader in Italy, while it is second to NIQ in France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain. Of those markets, NIQ faces closer competition by Circana and IQVIA in France, Germany and Greece, while it has a market share of above 75% in Spain."

Furthermore, they argue that the Commission may leave open the ques tion of whether the following segmentations may be appropriate:\nSegmentation according to the type of production process used, between grey, blue, and green hydrogen. The Parties point out that the current volume of production of blue and green hydrogen i s extremely limited compared to grey hydrogen, representing a minimal part of the supply and demand in the hydrogen market and to the fact that, despite being more expensive to produce, green hydrogen\u2019s costs are expected to decrease significantly in the near future.\nSegmentation between, on the one hand, fossil -based hydrogen and, on the other hand, low -carbon and renewable hydrogen. The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, but argue that at least low -carbon and renewable hydrogen are part of the same market because (i) the production processes are similar (the key difference being the source of the electricity used), (ii) preference of customers, especially in the mobility sector, for low -carbon and renewable hydrogen, as a way to decarbonise the sector, and (iii) the fact that most hydrogen suppliers will be offering a mix of both low -carbon and renewable hydrogen to their customers in the coming years.\nSegmentation according to the hydrogen\u2019s application or end use, betwee n hydrogen used in industrial applications, energy sector, and mobility. The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, noting however (i) the nascent nature of the new decarbonised hydrogen uses and (ii) the role that blue and green hydrogen are intended to play in the decarbonisation efforts in the mobility sector."

    "text": "The Commission has not yet considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV.\nHowever, t he Commission has previously considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of motor fuels. In that context , contrary to the retail sale of motor fuel products for B2C customers which may take place both at a national and local level, sales to B2B customers are essentially national because fuel card s are issued for national consumption, with prices either set nationally or with a fixed reduction to the local price and covering a nation- wide network of petrol stations.\nThe Parties consider that, unlike the traditional fuel retail markets, which are l ocal in scope, in the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV competition exists between operators at an earlier point in time and at a European level, or at least national level , for the following reasons:\nFirst, competition between HRS operators does not take place at the refuelling location since there is no spontaneous decision- making by the truck driver during his or her journey. Instead, the journey of a hydrogen truck driver will be carefully planned with a clear idea from the onset on where and when to refill at a n HRS. Competition between HRS offerings takes place at an earlier stage, when transporters compare available solutions and enter into a contract with a n HRS operator (either at project developer stage, or when already operational), when it is in the process of transitioning its fleet to hydrogen and needs to be reassured about the viability of the network for its trucks, or when it has already transitioned its fleet to hydrogen.\nSecond, B2B customers travel large distances intern ationally with HDV on a larger fuel autonomy. These vehicles typically have a range of 500 to 800 km with the technology currently available, and several HDV manufacturers are hoping to increase this range beyond 1000 km by 2030. Liquefied hydrogen technol ogy, which is currently under consideration for 2026/2027, could contribute to extending truck autonomy beyond 1000 km. As a result, a network of HRS for HDV could be spread over a large area and across multiple countries.\nThird, the JV\u2019s main customers will be major stakeholders with Europe -wide needs. [\u2026]. As a result, these international customers negotiate conditions at a supra -national level with international retail operators, [\u2026]."

The market investigation showed that transporters do not generally spontaneously decide to refuel. When asked to explain, respondents noted \u2018 the limited number of stations available today \u2019. Most respondents also indicated that there are currently no significant price differences or differentiated commercial or marketing offerings between HRS located near motorway exits and those located in logistic hubs .\nThe results of the market investig ation were inconclusive when it comes to the exact scope of such fuel agreements between customers and HRS operators.

To entice entry by a competitor, the Prospective Entrant needs clear and verifiable  principles, as well as legal certainty, notably concer ning the award of Grandfathering rights, in order to decide whether or not to apply for the Slots.

Consequently, when applying a literal interpretation of the concepts used in the Commitments, the appropriate use of the Slots should be understood as the absence of Misuse of these Slots.\nMisuse is defined in Clause 1.3 .5 of the Commitments, w hile \u201c appropriate use \u201d is not defined. The existence of a definition of \" Misuse \" and the absence of a definition of \" appropriate use \" in the Commitments points towards a  correlation between \" appropriate use \" and \" absence of Misuse \". Since Misuse of the Slots is deemed to arise under a number of circumstances listed in Clause 1.3 .5, a situation which does not give rise to Misuse can , a contrario, be considered as \u201cappropriate use \u201d of the Slots.  By making  refer ence to  a concept which is defined in the Commitments, this interpretation is the only one which  would provide the Prospective Entrant with sufficiently clear and verifiable guidance and which would fulfil the requirements of legal certainty ."

    "topic": "O&D city-pair approach",
    "text": "In its practice, the Commission has traditionally defined the relevant market for scheduled passenger air transport services on the basis of the \"point of origin/point of destination\" (\"O&D\") city-pair approach. Such a market definition reflects the demand-side perspective whereby passengers consider all possible alternatives of travelling from a city of origin to a city of destination, which they do not consider substitutable to a different city-pair. As a result, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination is considered a separate market. In the past, the Commission has also taken into consideration supply-side elements such as network competition between airlines based on the hub and spoke structure of traditional carriers. However, the Commission considered that the degree of supply-side substitutability between different O&Ds remains limited. It considered in this respect that, although from a supply-side perspective a network carrier could in theory fly from any point of origin to any point of destination, in practice network carriers build their network and decide to fly almost exclusively on routes connecting to their hubs.\n In line with the Commission's notice on market definition, the Commission has given pre-eminence to demand-side substitution, whereby it considered that customers still need the transportation from one point to another and that competition still takes place on an O&D city-pair basis (even though some customers, in particular corporate customers, may have concluded corporate agreements for a range of routes and the commercial advantages stemming from such agreements may lead them to prefer one airline among the different airlines that operate on the route). It has thus traditionally upheld the O&D approach."

Traditionally these two groups of passengers have been labelled as time sensitive (\"TS\") and non-time sensitive (\"NTS\") passengers, respectively.\n In light of the above, the effects of the Transaction will be assessed on the narrowest possible markets, namely on a market for TS passengers and on a market for NTS passengers."

The Commission has sometimes distinguished mid-haul routes, which are routes of more than three hours where direct flights normally do not provide the option of one-day return trips, so that indirect flights may be able to compete with direct flights. With respect to long-haul routes (more than 6 hours flight duration), the Commission has considered in the past that indirect flights constitute a competitive alternative to direct services under certain conditions (for example if they are marketed as connecting flights on the O&D pair in the computer reservation system).\n The question of the substitutability of direct and indirect flights, which is relevant for flights from London to Riyadh and Jeddah, will be examined in the competitive assessment of these routes."

The results of the market investigation in the present case w ould appear to confirm the Commission\u2019s past practice.

One competitor, for instance, stated \u201cThere are not significant short -liners in Italy \u201d.

    "topic": "Pharmaceutical Wholesaling vs. Direct Deliveries by Manufacturers",
    "text": "The Commission notes that, in its past decisional practice, it has defined a product market for pharmaceutical wholesaling separate from direct deliveries performed by manu facturers. The market investigation results confirm the Commission\u2019s past practice. The market inve stigation feedback indicates that in Italy direct deliveries are particularly present in relation to certain products, such as generics, OTC, and other products, while they exercise much less pressure for the delivery of branded Rx products. This would be mirrored in the data submitted by the Notifying Party, which show that, by value, the share of direct sales for Rx products corresponds to 13.8%, whereas the share of direct sales for OTC and para -pharmaceuticals corresponds to 39.3%. Competitors who respo nded to the market investigation evidenced that direct deliveries exercise pressure on wholesalers to the extent that they focus on the delivery of higher -margin products, such as OTC and para -pharmaceuticals, at lower costs, since manufacturers only perfo rm these d eliveries in bulk and less than once a week. On the contrary, competi tors stress that all full- line wholesalers must be able to supply at all times the entire list of pharmaceuticals, even the lower -margin products, and they have to deliver these products to their customers once per day, at the very least, while generally they offer two deliveries per day. The slight majority of customers who responded to the market investigation confirmed that their needs for Rx products are covered by direct deliveries for very limited portions, i.e. , less than 5%, whereas direct deliveries would represent approximately 30% of their sourcing needs in relation to other products, such as OTC and para -pharmaceuticals. Based on the market investigation results, the Commission observes that customers need to be supplied by wholesalers at least once a day and generally in Italy they are supplied twice a day. Pharmacies rely on having short -term access to the full range of products in order to have them available at all times , and only wholesalers are in a position to supply the full range of products to customers on short notice and regularly. Therefore, while direct deliveries may be considered as an out -of-market competitive constraint, they do not belong to the same product market of wholesaling activities as they cannot be considered as full substitutes to the service provided by wholesalers, namely because they do not provide pharmacies regularly and they generally do not supply the full r ange of products. In light of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the relevant product market should encompass only wholesaling activities and exclude direct deliveries from its scope."

    "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission considered -albeit leaving the product marked definition opened - that biscuits constitute a separate market from waffles and cakes. The Commission also considered the distinction between sweet and savoury biscuit markets. Within the sweet biscuits market, the Commission considered further segmentations (i) between products which are branded (\u2018B\u2019) or have a private label (\u2018PL\u2019); (ii) by customer (retailers vs food-service channel \u2013 restaurants, hotels, fast-food outlets, schools, hospitals) by category (form \u2013 sandwiched/ plain; and taste \u2013 chocolate coated, filled ). The Commission has however left in these previous decisions the precise product market definition open. For instance, the Commission considered a further segmentation by category (form \u2013 sandwiched/ plain; and taste \u2013 chocolate coated, filled ) in Case M.4828 - Kraft/Danone Biscuits but eventually came to the conclusion that in that case such a segmentation was not warranted."

However, as the Parties\u2019 activities do not overlap in the production of waffles or cakes, it considers that the exact product market definition can be left open . As the Parties\u2019 activities do not overlap on savoury biscuits, the Notifying Party does not give its opinion on this plausible segmentation of the savoury biscuits market. However, the Notifying Party considers that any further segmentation of the sweet biscuit market is not warranted for the following reasons. First, consumers view the various sweet biscuits types , including branded and non-branded, interchangeably . Second, there is no \u201cmust -stock\u201d product category from the retailers\u2019 perspective. Third, sweet biscuit manufacturers can easily enter new biscuit segments and several already supply both branded and non -branded products."

For retailers there is a considerable difference in the margins made with one or the other product and confronted with a price increase in a private label product, the majority of respondents said they would not switch to a branded product. Although some sweet biscuit suppliers are active in both private label and branded products, they usually focus on one of these activities and not seldom, their presence in the branded products is via co-manufacturing arrangements with the brand holder. The majority of respondents to our market investigation that supply both private label and branded products, consider that it is difficult to switch from private label to branded products as this requires significant investments in the product lines but also in advertising (if they were to build a new brand and not enter into a co -manufacturing arrangement) ."

    "text": "Firstly, the Commission notes that the sale to Dnata would lead to the reinforcement of the smallest of the firms currently operating in the FCO in -flight catering market , allow ing Dnata to compete more effectively against the Notifying Party . Indeed, Dnata currently has a market share of [10-20]% of the in -flight catering market at FCO . Given , as explained in paragraph 38 below, the limited demand for in-flight catering supply at Rome FCO and the declining trend of the market , the sale would strengthen Dnata\u2019s ability to compete with Gategroup at FCO in the future. \nIn particular, the severe deterioration of th e market situation at FCO , which was considerably exacerbated by the COVID -19 epidemic , has led to a n important overcapacity , likely to persist for the foreseeable future, intensifying the competitive situation between the remaining in -flight caterers, including Dnata , as confirmed by the Trustee . According to the Trustee, there is in fact currently no appreciable market at Rome FCO due to tremendous volume -reductions. The Notifying Party understand s that [\u2026]. The increased contract volume brought about by the FCO Divestment Business would thus [\u2026], which could lead to a more competitive market environment in the in-flight catering market at FCO . \nSecondly, the Commission observe s that the structure of demand for in-flight catering situation at FCO does not seem to be attractive for new entrants . Unlike at other airports in European capitals, no new entry other than Gategroup had occurred over the past five years. In the future, FCO is expected to increasingly miss out on long-haul routes and become more and more a low cost destination (which is often served with retail on board products instead of in -flight catering) , with the Notifying Party expecting it to rather function as a \u201cregional airport\u201d. The COVID -19 cr isis has further deteriorated the attractiveness of FCO. [\u2026], [\u2026]. After inquiring with [\u2026] potential purchasers on 18 September 2020 directly , the Commission comes to the conclusion that Dnata seems to indeed be the only realistic and credible purchaser for the FCO Divestment Business. \nNew entry is therefore highly unlikely at FCO , in view notably of the reduction of the total size of the market for in-flight catering services at FCO . This situation is unlikely to change in the short and medium term. The COVID -19 crisis has further deteriorated this market situation at FCO. It is thus unlikely that any new entrant would be interested in entering the FCO in -flight catering market and that it could run the FCO Divestment Business in a profitable way, particu larly in the current economic context."

Regarding the Belgian Divestment Business, according to the Reasoned Proposal, there will be no change to the market structure, which currently consists of two competitors (i.e. Newrest -Servair and LSG). Newrest will become the sole shareholder of the Newrest -Servair Joint Venture and would continue to face competition from the combined Gategroup/LSG EU entity at BRU.

    "text": "According to previous decisions, the market for refined fuel products can be divided into upstream (exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas) and downstream activities. Upstream activities include the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Downstream activities encompass the marketing and distribution of refined fuel products . In previous cases, the Commission consistently distinguished three different levels of distribution, two of which occur at the wholesale level (i.e. (i) ex -refinery sales and (i i) non -retail sales) and a third which relates to retail sales (i.e. sales exclusively to end customers). At the wholesale level , the primary level of distribution, ex -refinery sales, typically includes the supply to wholesalers, traders or the internal w holesale arm of the refiners. The second level of distribution, non-retail sales , encompasses the supply to independent resellers or retailers not integrated upstream and to large industrial and commercial consumers by secondary means of transport (e.g., t rucks). At the wholesale and non -retail sales level, separate markets have been defined by fuel type due to their different characteristics, use and purchasers. Accordingly, at least the following markets within the first and second level s of wholesale distribution can be distinguished: supply of (i) diesel, (ii) gasoline, (iii) LPG, (iv) heavy fuel oil and (v) light fuel oil. The \u2018traditional\u2019 fuel segments also include their biofuel variant (e.g., the market segment for diesel also includes biodiesel, an d the market for LPG also includes bio LPG)."

In particular, the Notifying Parties argue that there will be limited demand -side substitutability between tradition al refined oil products such as LPG and rDME, essentially due to the required equipment conversion costs (necessary to switch from LPG use to rDME use) and the premium price of sustainable fuels such as rDME as opposed to cheaper traditional products inclu ding fossil LPG. The results of the market investigation generally confirmed that rDME might constitute a separate product market from those of traditional fuels. In particular, the majority of competitors responding to the market investigation agreed th at rDME prices would , when it starts to be commercialised , be substantially higher than the prices for t raditional refined oil products, that LPG equipment would need adaptation to be used with pure rDME (it is estimated that blended LPG with a maximum of 20% rDME would not entail the need to modify existing LPG equipment) , and that current LPG producers would not easily switch their production to rDME, given the \u201c different production technology and equipment required \u201d. Moreover, only a small minority of the respondents to the Commission\u2019s market investigation (two competitors) indicated that the market for LPG and other refined oil products should encompass rDME , whilst the vast majority stated that rDME should form a separate market (e.g. \u201c[\u2026] the cos t of modifications to switch from LPG or blended LPG to pure rDME mean that LPG or blended LPG and pure rDME are not directly substitutable. This suggests that pure rDME would form a distinct segment of the market \u201d); or they could not ascertain the exact p roduct segmentation at this stage given the prospective nature of rDME production in the EEA (e.g. \u201c we do not possess enough data at this time to determine LPG and pure rDME are capable of being freely substituted for each other \u201d)."

Brandy and whisky were further segmented according to origin: (i) for brandy, different markets were considered for Cognac and Armagnac; and (ii) for whisky different markets were considered for Scotch, Irish, US, Canadian.\nIn a previous case, the Commission also considered the possible existence of separate markets for the supply of spirits depending on whether they are on -trade (i.e: sales to hotels, bars, caf \u00e9s, etc) or off -trade (i.e: sales to the retail sector). However, the Commission ultimately concluded that this delineation would not change the competitive assessment as the transaction in question in that case would primarily concern off-trade, i.e. sales to wholesalers and large retailers. In the present case the delineation would not change the competitive assessment since Tannico is present essentially in the direct sales to final customers ( [\u2026]% of Tannico turnover is represented by sales to final consumers).\nThe Notifying Parties consider that for the purposes of the assessment of their vertical relationships with Tannico and in line with previous Commission\u2019s decisions, it would be sufficient to examine the following hypothetical product markets at the production and wholesale level : (i) Still Wines, (ii) Sparkling Wines, (iii) Agave -Based Spirits, (iv) Brandy, (v) Rum, (vi) Vodka, and (vii) Whisky.

As to the type of beverage sold, the Notifying Parties consider that it is not relevant to segment the retail market by type of beverage, as retailers of wines and spirits typically offer a broad portfolio across the board of wines and spirits (as well as other alcoholic beverages, such as beer, cider, and ready -to-drink beverages ), and could easily shift their capacity/shelf space from one product offered in store towards another in reaction to price increases.\nThe results of the market investigation support the fact that retailers purchase the whole range of wines and spirits as all retailers that expressed a view explained that they purchase the whole range of wines and spirits. Indeed, the retailers aim to offer a broad selection of wines and spirits to the final consumer to maximise their revenues. For example, one retailer pointed out in the market investigation that \u2018Our product portfolio has 3000 wine references and 3000 spirits references \u2019.

In certain decisions, the Commission also distinguished between life insurance for individuals and for group customers. Furthermore, a distinction between unit -linked life insurance products on the one hand and non-unit -linked life insurance products on the other hand was considered as well , depending on the product and country in question. In M.4701 \u2013 Generali / PPF Insurance Business , the Commission looked at unit -linked savings and investment products. In M.8257 \u2013 NN Group / Delta Lloyd, the Commission discussed a separate market for unit -linked insurance for certain pension products and savings and investment products. In M.9796 \u2013 Uniqa / Axa, a plausible market for index-linked and unit -linked life insurance was assessed for Slovakia. In some cases, the Commission has considered additional segmentations of the life insurance sector, including based on national insurance classifications. However, from a supply- side perspective, the Commission has recognised that the conditions for the provision of life insurance covering different risk types are quite similar and most large insurance companies are active in several risk types, which suggests that many different types of life insurance could be included in the same relevant product market."

    "text": "The Commission has previously considered a segmentation of the relevant product market for the supply of coating resins by (i) delivery technology, (ii) chemistry and (iii) industrial application.  A segmentation by delivery technology distinguishes between the following categories of coating resins: (i) liquid resins that can be further segmented into solvent borne and waterborne resins, (ii) radiation curable resins (\u201cradcure\u201d) and (iii) powder resins. The Commission considered that liquid, radcure and powder resins differ from one another in terms of production process, the way they are applied to the substrate, the curing time, the residue they leave behind and their environmental friendliness and are not substitutable with one another and constitute separate markets.  A segmentation by chemistry distinguishes coating resins by reference to the base chemical compound of the resin. Common chemistries of coating resins include acrylics, alkyds, epoxies, polyurethanes and polyesters or hybrids thereof, comprising two or more such chemistries. Different base chemicals impart different performance characteristics to the coating, and the chemistry that a resin manufacturer and its customers choose is generally driven by the requirements of the coating\u2019s intended industrial application. By reference to the industrial application, the Commission has previously considered segmenting coating resins into: (i) Automotive OEM; (ii) Automotive refinish; (iii) Industrial Wood ; (iv) Coil and pre -coated metals; (v) Other Industrial uses; (vi) Marine; (vii) Special Purpose; (viii) Packaging; (ix) Architectural; and (x) Adjacent coating and non-coating applications While considering it appropriate to segment the market for coating applications by industrial applications as well, the Commission left the market open."

Siligom SAS will reinforce the Glass Auto Service label and its network by integrating Siliglass\u2019 workshops into the Glass Auto Service label, in order to increase the national coverage of the network, to over 400 garages. Siligom SAS will also maintain the existing framework agreements concluded between Glass Auto Service and insurance companies. Independent garages belonging to Siliglass will also benefit from these agreements, reinforcing the overall network. Siligom SAS will also take over all of Glass Auto Service\u2019s employees. Siligom SAS will provide all of the technical, administrative, commercial, communication and IT support services currently provided to Siliglass, to Glass Auto Service, thereby ensuring that Glass Auto Service benefits from a broad range of support services.\n\nThe Trustee considers that the proposed transaction is an opportunity for Siligom SAS to accelerate its development in the vehicle glass repair and replacement market where it has been active since 2020. It will enable Siliglass to benefit from framework agreements with insurers that currently work with Glass Auto Service. In addition, the Trustee notes that Glass Auto Service\u2019s network can be seen as complementary to that of Siliglass and will therefore enable Siligom SAS to reinforce its geographic footprint in vehicle glass repair. Through the combination of the two networks, Siligom SAS can strengthen its position in this glass repair market and increase its bargaining power with its suppliers. The Trustee therefore concludes that Siligom SAS has the incentive to maintain and develop Glass Auto Service."

As a result, the Divestment Business has only a marginal production of secondary cast aluminium of less than [\u2026] leading to a small increment (below [0-5]%) in a market where Aurea\u2019s market share is already very limited (i.e. approx.

    "text": "The Commission considers that, consistent with its past practice and absent indications to the contrary from the market investigation, a distinction by metal type is warranted. First, the different metal types have different applications and characteristics. For example, aluminium is significantly lighter than copper or steel. Copper and aluminium have better electrical conductivity characteristics than steel. Steel has much better resistance to heat. Second, the different metal types are not always offered by the same suppliers. As an example, the Target focuses on aluminium products and [80- 90]% of its sales volumes are accounted for by that metal, as explained in paragraph (9) above. In addition, some customers require only one type of metal. For example, a transport company may be using a large quantity of aluminium to produce, for example, trailers, and may not have a need for other types of metals. As a result, and for the purpose of this decision, the Commission will consider that the distribution of aluminium constitutes a separate market from the distribution of other metals."

More specifically, the Commission referred to the ATC3 level, where pharmaceuticals are grouped in terms of their therapeutic indications, i.e. their intended use, as the starting point for defining the relevant product market, since these groups of products generally have the same therapeutic indication and cannot be substituted by products belonging to other ATC 3 classes . However, the Commission has also recognised that it may be appropriate, to carry out analyses at the narrower classification level ATC4, or possibly at the level of groups of molecules or individual molecules. Relevant factors to take into account include therapeutic ( e.g. prescription only, or administration allowed only under medical supervision) or pharmacological criteria such as molecule class, formulation or mode of administration. The Notifying Parties submit that the product market definition can be left open because irrespective of the exact scope of the relevant product market, no competition concerns would arise.

For sales in far -away regions, traders may also have better knowledge of demand, supply and pricing and be better placed to communicate with local customers. Traders can eliminate suppliers\u2019 payment risks with respect to certain customers and regions by acting as an intermediary.

The Commission has further considered that there are three types of suppliers providing into-plane supplies of aviation fuels at airports:\n\u2212 Into-plane suppliers, which supply the largest quantities of aviation fuels to airline companies and other smaller suppliers active at the airport (throughputters and resellers, see below). Into-plane suppliers have direct access to the distribution infrastructure at the airports.\n\u2212 Throughputters, which supply aviation fuels to airline companies as well as to resellers, but do not own or control any fuelling infrastructure at the airports.\n\u2212 Resellers, which supply aviation fuel to various customers at the airport, usually acquiring the fuel at wingtip (i.e., once it has passed through the infrastructure of the airport and is readily available to be supplied to the end-customer).\nIn PKN Orlen/Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered separate product markets for (i) into-plane supply of aviation fuels by both suppliers and throughputters on the one hand, and (ii) into-plane supply of aviation fuels by resellers on the other.\nFurther, in that same case, the Commission considered that the into-plane supply of aviation gasoline is to be distinguished from the into-plane supply of jet fuel. Considering that the Transaction would only give rise to vertically affected markets as regards the into-plane supply of jet fuel, this decision will not further discuss aviation gasoline.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest the Commission\u2019s previous findings.\nThe results of the market investigation also did not provide reasons for the Commission to depart from the findings in its past decisions. For the purposes of this decision the exact market definition for the into-plane supply of aviation fuels can be left open, as the Transaction does not lead to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market, regardless of the market definition adopted.\nIn line with its previous findings, the Commission will conduct its assessment on the basis of a market for into-plane supply of aviation fuel by both suppliers and throughputters, excluding into-plane sales by resellers."

The Commission has therefore assessed whether the reacquisition of influence by Wind Tre over the Divestment Spectrum affects Iliad\u2019s ability and incentive to compete as an MNO , as envisaged by the Commitments . The Commission finds that such reacquisition does not undermine the effectiveness of the Commitments ."

Respondents to the market investigation observed that 2-EHA is not easily substitutable with other carboxylic acids. This would therefore rather point to a distinct market for 2-EHA. For the present case, the definition of the exact product market can be left open, as no competition concerns would arise under any plausible product market definition."

In any case, the Commission has found that, at the wholesale level of distribution, a further segmentation within PCs and LCVs based on types of vehicles (i.e. distinguishing between PC segments A, B, C, etc. and Small LCVs, Medium LCVs, etc.) would not be appropriate since manufacturers distribute model ranges which cover vehicles across the different categories and both importers and retailers of a given brand offer typically all or a wide range of the vehicles offered by that brand."

The Parties understand that Pentair, based on internal estimates, assesses that it has a worldwide market share for commercial water filtration of approximat ely [10-20]% , and an EEA market share of around [10- 20]% . Moreover, water filtration systems are not required to operate commercial ice-making machines, are not integrated into the ice -making machines, and are installed as an add -on to improve water delive red to a variety of appliances on a mix -and match basis. As a result, while the water filtration systems are a complementary product, there is not a strong correlation between the demand for commercial ice machines and water filters. In the market for wate r filtration products, Pentair faces competition from rival suppliers such as Ecolab, 3M, Brita, Kinetico (formerly Selecto), BWT and Total Water. If it tried to engage in an input foreclosure strategy, the Divestiture Business\u2019s rival ice -making machine m anufacturers (and other consumers of filters for ice machines) would have a variety of alternative filter suppliers from which to buy. Therefore, the acquisition of the Divestment Business by Pentair does not risk giving rise to any anti-competitive effect s, as it will not increase market concentration, will not result in any vertical or conglomerate effects and specifically in market foreclosure concerns, and will not raise any other competitive risks regarding potential exchange of competitively sensitive  information."

    "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission has left open whether the geographic market for these activities is EEA-wide, national or sub-national in scope. As regards the retail distribution of used vehicles, the Commission concluded in previous cases that the geographic scope could be considered sub-national, although it left the definition of the market open between EEA-wide, national or sub-national. The Notifying Party notes that the German Federal Cartel Office did not yet conclude on the exact geographic scope of retail distribution markets for (new or used) PCs and LCVs. Nonetheless, the Notifying Party considers the relevant retail market to be national in scope as customers increasingly use the internet to compare prices across the country (in particular with respect to used cars) and are willing to travel longer distances to buy a vehicle, exemplified by increasing interest in factory pick-up. In any event, the Notifying Party considers that the exact definition of the geographic scope of the market can be left open. The Commission will retain the geographic market definition provided in its past decisional practice as described in paragraph (20).

    "topic": "Gas Storage Capacity",
    "text": "It is apparent from the information available to the Commission that the economic context for gas is not favourable to the reservation of storage capacity. Since November 2008, wholesale gas prices have remained significantly lower than the prices for long-term supply contracts3. Gas shippers are therefore induced to make greater use of short-term gas supplies for which storage is unnecessary. Moreover, throughout 2010 the limited difference in the market price of gas for the summer 2010 and winter 2010/2011 seasons provided little incentive for shippers to reserve storage capacity in which to stock gas over the summer of 20104. Storengy, the GDF subsidiary which manages storage sites, pointed to an unprecedented decline in the take-up of storage capacity for the 2010/2011 gas year5. In view of the above, the conclusion can be made that there are legitimate grounds for GDF Suez\u2019s request for the lifting of Commitment No 73. It should also be noted that GDF Suez accompanied its Final Request with commitments which are likely to ensure maximum success in the future sale of storage capacity, in particular with respect to the offer of multiannual capacity and the fixing of a ceiling for the reserve price."

    "text": "Demand for existing gas transmission capacity from France to Belgium (reverse flow capacity) is low at the Taisni\u00e8res interconnection point. Indeed it can be noted that over the past two years only a monthly average of 42% of reverse flow capacity was reserved and the monthly reservation rate never exceeded 58%. So existing reverse flow capacity is far from saturated by existing demand, which would seem to confirm that there is no market demand for an extension to capacity to take gas from France to Belgium from Taisni\u00e8res. The interruptible nature of the reverse flow capacity does not appear to be the cause for the low level of take-up since, to date, there has never been an interruption of the reverse flows. The physical throughput of gas has always been sufficient to allow for an uninterrupted reverse flow. It is therefore highly unlikely that the installation of a deodorisation plant that would give rise to firm capacity would significantly change demand for the transmission of gas from France to Belgium through Taisni\u00e8res."

Moreover, the supply of replacement short -term car rental services appears to constitute a distinct market , in particular due to the fact that customers in this segment are generally insurance companies and not all suppliers are active in this segment.\n\nSecond, the Parties in their internal documents assess the short -term and long -term segments, and leisure and corporate  segments separately.\n\nThird, market shares are materially different between replacement services and other car rental services as well as between passenger and commercial car  rental services."

    "text": "The Commission\u2019s investigation indicates  that a separate market exists for the manufacture and supply of new vehicles to car rental companie s, without a need to further segment it .\n\nSeveral elements support this conclusion.\n\nFirst, a majority of respondents to the market investigation who expressed a view indicated  that vehicle sales to car rental companies are made at diffe rent prices and supply conditions (for example, buy-back or leasing arrangements) than those to end customers. For instance, one car rental company indicated that \u2018the conditions offered to car rental companies are very specific to the car rental industry  and, to our knowledge, not offered to other customers. Vehicles are supplied on the basis of buy-back or leasing agreements \u2019, one OEM responded that \u2018the conditions for the sale of vehicles to rental companies is completely different from those made to other customers\u2019, and another indicated that \u2018rebates & holding periods (in case of buy -back) for STR  [short -term rental]  are different from the other channels \u2019. One car rental company indicated  that \u2018the supply of vehicles to rental companies is a separate market from the supply of cars to other companies in particular due to the difference in pricing and further conditions \u2019. Indeed, car rental companies hold vehicles for a limited period of time, usually a few months, and tend to purchase them subject to buy-back agreements with OEMs under which vehicles are sold back to OEMs at a pre -defined price after a certain period of time. To a lesser extent car rental companies source vehicles under leasing arrangements or standard purchases. On the other hand, the  majority of car rental companies who  expressed an opinion with respect to the affected markets were of the view that suppliers other than OEMs such as leasing companies, new car dealers and used cars dealers can supply them with cars. However, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under the narrowest plausible market definition, there is no need to discuss a wider market definition.\n\nSecond, the range of vehicles  to be supplie d is negotiated between car rental companies and OEMs. A  majority of car rental companies who expressed a view in the market investigation indicate s that they purchase ranges of cars with some flexibility on the exact product mix, which is ultimately to a l arge extent determined by OEMs. Similarly, in the pre -notification interviews, one car rental company indicated that it \u2018typically informs the OEMs of the volume it wants to purchase, and the OEMs decide on the splits and models, and therefore ultimately on the car mix . By way of overview of the process, [the car rental company] specifies the number of units, the specification of such units e.g. fuel type, transmission type, the ratio between risk and buy -back and mix of vehicle type (small, medium, large vehicles). The relevant OEM engages with [the car rental company]  accordingly in respect of each of these criteria in the context of its vehicle production. Though the process is iterative, the OEM ultimately determines and controls what it can deliver to [the car rental company] , which outcomes inform [the car rental company] \u2019s comparable conversations with other OEMs and fleet strategy \u2019.\n\nThird, Volkswagen \u2019s internal documents analyse the supply of cars to the car rental companies separately from the supply of cars to other customers."

In particular, one broker explained that \u2018a rental company based in the airport building is certainly in competition with a provider outside an airport. The basis of the consideration here is that vehicles from providers located outside an airport can be significantly cheaper for the same service.

In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed opinion indicated that prices of the same cars differ between Member States . In particular, one car rental company explained that \u2018prices are negotiated on country level and can differ up to 10%.

The Notifying Party further agrees that a distinction should be made between mineral wools on the one hand and foams on the other hand since: (i) from a supply side perspective, production processes are very different; (ii) while mineral wools have better fire protection qualities, foams are better at handling moisture; and (iii) from a demand side perspective, such differing technical characteristics lead to differing use cases. Based on technical specifications and prices, the Notifying Party indicate that an even further sub-segmentation for both mineral wools and foams is conceivable.\nThe Commission considers that, consistently with its past practice and absent indications to the contrary from the market investigation, plausible relevant product markets for the production and supply of insulation materials can be defined distinguishing between a product market for mineral wools and a product market for foams.\nIn any event, it can be left open whether the market for the production and supply of insulation materials should be segmented into separate potential markets for mineral wools and foams, as the assessment of the Transaction\u2019s compatibility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement would not change under any plausible product market definition.

These properties are generally used to store inventory for longer periods of time or to consolidate shipments into smaller ones. Light industrial properties, on the other hand, are generally understood to be smaller scale properties used for light manufacturing, assembly and storage purposes. The Commission has also considered that both logistics and light industrial properties can be further segmented by quality into prime and secondary properties. Prime properties are newer, modern properties that benefit from a good location and are generally fully let. Secondary properties, on the other hand, are older properties that may be located in less attractive areas and which are more likely to be vacant.

Therefore, the product market definition should accurately represent the Notifying Parties\u2019 share of all cash handling demand by banks in Slovakia for the purpose of the competitive assessment. As cash handling is primarily used to provision bank branches and ATMs, the Notifying Parties\u2019 share of the total number of Slovak bank branches and ATMs is a good proxy for their downstream market share. Furthermore, the Notifying Parties\u2019 share of the total number of Slovak bank branches and ATMs is roughly in line with their combined market share in retail banking and corporate banking. Therefore, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition for retail and corporate banking can be left open. For the purpose of the present Decision, the Commission will use the Notifying Parties\u2019 share of Slovakia\u2019s bank branches and ATMs to assess the Notifying Parties\u2019 market share position downstream of cash handling services, as banks\u2019 cash handling needs are primarily driven by the servicing of ATMs and branches.

    "text": "Within the market for accommodation in holidays parks, market participants interviewed by the Commission and the Parties\u2019 internal documents suggest that holiday parks could be differentiated according to the level of services they offer. The differences relate to factors such as the size and quality of the accommodations, the choice of central facilities and activities offered in the parks and the general state of the park (new or renovated on the one hand or old on the other). Nevertheless, it seems that further segmenting the market for accommodation in holidays parks according to quality groups may not be appropriate. First, the interplay between the factors noted above leads to a wide spectrum of holidays parks on offer and there do not seem to be clear criteria by which holiday parks can be segmented into quality groups. There also seems to be a degree of substitutability between some of these factors. In addition, each operator may offer different levels of services between its own holiday parks. Indeed, the Parties and other holiday park operators in Germany offer a varying degree of services and central facilities between their parks that may categorise the same operator in different quality groups. Furthermore, with respect to \u2018four season holidays parks\u2019 referred to by the ACM in its Gran Dorado/Center Parcs decision of 2001, it seems that there have been developments in the market and today holiday parks may be open year-round even with limited offer of central facilities and services. Indeed, the Parties, in their internal documents, and market participants interviewed by the Commission refer to holiday parks as belonging to one market with differentiated offer rather than divided into separate markets according to quality of services."

Both repair and replacement lead to the same result for the customer, a fixed windscreen without the driver\u2019s view being impaired . The only difference consists of higher costs for replacement , as an insured motorist might have to pay an excess of EUR 50 -180.

Demand in this market is highly localised. Customers are unwilling to travel more than 30 or 45 minutes in order to have a windshield repaired or replaced, and insurers seek to offer their policy holders options as close to their home or place of work as possible. However, this means that to be competitive, repair networks need to be dense and cover the whole country. From a supply- side perspective however, it appears that the conditions of competition in this market are fairly homogeneous across metropolitan France. A majority of customers who responded consider that motorists tend to have similar alternatives wherever they are in metropolitan France, though a majority of competitors pointed to differences between rural and urban areas. All respondents confirmed that the main glass repair networks are active throughout the whole of metropolitan France. A large majority of respondents also confirmed that prices do not vary significantly across metropolitan France. For national networks of glass specialists which enter into framework agreements with insurers and fleet -owners, prices are usually set nationally, with some variation between the Parisian region and the rest of the country to account for differences in labour costs . The component of the price which reflects the cost of spare parts however does not vary."

In the case of original spare parts, due to the virtually non- existent demand -side substitutability of spare parts for one specific car brand with those for another brand, the Commission has considered separate brand -specific markets for the wholesale distribution of spare parts through the OEM channel , while the same does not apply to the IAM channel .

Wrought aluminum is typically worked in a solid form through methods such as rolling, forging and extrusion to shape the final product. Cast aluminum contains larger percentages of other alloying elements compared to wrought aluminum."

According to this approach, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination should be considered to be a separate market from the customer's viewpoint. To establish whether an O&D pair forms a relevant product market, the Commission considers the different possibilities offered to consumers to travel between these two points. The Commission will not only consider the direct flights between the two airports concerned, but also other transport alternatives to the extent that they are substitutable to these direct flights. These alternatives may include direct flights between other airports which have overlapping catchment areas with the airports concerned at each end (airport substitution), indirect flights between the airports concerned, or other means of transport such as road, train or sea (inter-modal substitution). Whether one of those alternatives is substitutable to the direct route depends on a multiplicity of factors, such as the overall travel time, frequency of services and the price of the different alternatives. This can only be decided on a route-by-route basis. The parties have accepted this approach. However, the parties also maintain that, from the supply side perspective, there are clear indications that airlines increasingly compete on a network-to-network basis."

Some competitors have suggested that this difference no longer reflect the requirements of passengers and the commercial policy of the airlines. However, customers and travel agents have confirmed the importance for certain travellers (mainly business passengers) to the possibility to modify their tickets and return as soon as possible to their point of origin, preferably within the day if a short-haul route (this requirement does not, obviously, exclude that these customers are also -more and more, as argued by many respondents - price-sensitive). Time-sensitive passengers have therefore different requirements than non-sensitive ones and normally will only choose to fly airlines offering a high number of frequencies in a given O&D pair and the possibility to use unrestricted tickets. Therefore, the Commission considers the existence of two distinct markets for time-sensitive and non time-sensitive passengers when assessing the proposed merger\u0092s impact on competition on the different routes."

This is the case of some of the routes affected by the present transaction where a significant number of time-sensitive passengers even prefer the indirect service over the direct one.

The Commission concluded that indirect flights may constitute a competitive alternative to non-stop services if they are marketed as connecting flights on the city pair on computer reservation systems, are operated on a daily basis and cause only a limited extension of the trip (150 minutes waiting time). In recent transatlantic alliance decisions, the Commission followed a similar approach and concluded that indirect flights, under certain conditions, appear to exert a sufficient competitive constraint on non-stop long haul services. The degree to which an indirect flight is substitutable should be considered on a route-by-route basis."

However, corporate customers are only one customer group and, according to the market investigation, probably the most time-sensitive one. Other customer groups can accept longer connection times. Moreover, other elements brought by the market investigation mitigate this suggestions since, on long haul routes, the dividing line between time sensitive passengers and non time sensitive passengers has become less clear. As was reported by several parties (including the merging parties themselves) an increasing number of time-sensitive passengers appear to have become more price sensitive. In particular an increasing number of undertakings require their employees to take the most economical flights, including indirect flights, irrespective of total flight duration or longer connecting times. It is therefore still considered that the availability of flights with a maximum connection time of 150 minutes exert sufficient competitive constraint on long-haul direct flights."

    "topic": "Lead Sulphate Product Market Definition",
    "text": "The Commission has not previously defined the relevant product market for the supply of lead sulphate. The Notifying Party considers lead sulphate as a distinct product market and submits that no further segmentation would be relevant.\n\nIn this respect, the results of the investigations confirm the view that lead sulphate constitutes a separate market, distinct from other feedstock used for lead production.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, a distinction can be made between primary feedstock (i.e. lead concentrate) and secondary feedstock (i.e. lead sulphate and recycled materials). While primary feedstock generates heat when smelted, secondary feedstock and lead sulphate in particular consume heat when smelted. In this regard, the investigations confirmed that lead smelters are required to manage the heat balance of their lead smelting process, which limits demand substitutability between primary and secondary feedstock. This is also consistent with the Parties\u2019 internal documents.\n\nLikewise, demand substitutability between secondary feedstock (i.e. lead sulphate and recycled materials) appears limited. For instance, as one vertically integrated zinc smelter explained \u2018Secondary smelters only use materials derived from the recycling of batteries. These materials are very clean and consistent with high lead content and low impurities\u2019. As a result, secondary smelters cannot substitute lead sulphate for recycled materials and, conversely, primary smelters cannot substitute recycled materials for lead sulphate.\n\nThis is consistent with the results of the First Investigation, in which the majority of participants confirmed that switching from lead sulphate to other feedstock (including primary and other secondary feedstock) would require significant investments and considerable time for customers.\n\nFrom a supply perspective, lead sulphate, lead concentrate and scrap materials come from different sources and are supplied by different undertakings. In this respect, zinc smelters producing lead sulphate as a by-product are not able to produce metal concentrates (which are the result of mining operations) or metal scrap (which is produced by final users of metal products).\n\nWithin lead sulphate, the results of the investigations suggest that a further segmentation based on the composition of the lead sulphate could be appropriate. One lead smelter explained in this regard that a distinction can be made between:\n\n(a) lead sulphate from zinc smelters that have a goethite or jarosite residue pond (\u2018Type 1 lead sulphate\u2019). This lead sulphate has a relatively high concentration of lead and precious metals (such as gold and silver) and high moisture, because the iron content is captured in the precipitated goethite or jarosite molecules and separated in the residue pond.\n\n(b) lead sulphate from zinc smelters that do not have a goethite or jarosite residue pond (\u2018Type 2 lead sulphate\u2019). This lead sulphate has a higher concentration of iron, and therefore a lower concentration of lead and precious metals (such as gold and silver) and lower moisture.\n\n(c) lead sulphate can also result from the treatment of lead (\u2018Type 3 lead sulphate\u2019). In that case, it contains flue dusts and other residues. However, the composition of this type of lead sulphate is different from the by-product of zinc smelters as it typically has very low content of precious metals, if any.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, these three types of lead sulphate present different characteristics, especially in terms of moisture content, which plays an important role for lead smelters. As one lead smelter explained: \u2018All lead smelters pay attention to the moisture content, because the smelters need the capability and capacity to dry / process the lead concentrates or lead sulphates\u2019.\n\nThis is consistent with the information submitted by the Parties showing that [\u2026]. Again, the requirements of lead smelters in terms of heat balance limits demand substitutability between different types of lead sulphate with different moisture content.\n\nFrom a supply perspective, the circle of lead sulphate producers vary according to the type of lead sulphate (e.g. zinc smelters only produce Type 1 or 2 lead sulphate whereas other players can only produce Type 3 lead sulphate). As a result, supply-substitutability seems limited, at least between Type 1 and Type 2 lead sulphate on the one hand, and Type 3 lead sulphate, on the other hand.\n\nIn any event, for the purpose of this Decision, the distinction between different types of feedstock for lead production and between different types of lead sulphate can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts under any plausible product market definition. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Decision, the Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction under any product market definition that the Commission considers plausible, by distinguishing a separate market for lead sulphate with a further segmentation according to type of lead sulphate (as defined above)."

    "text": "The Commission has not previously defined the relevant geographic market for lead sulphate. The Notifying Party considers that the market for lead sulphate is likely to be worldwide.\n\nThe results of the investigations suggest that the geographic market for lead sulphate is at least EEA-wide and potentially broader (e.g. worldwide or worldwide excluding China). The vast majority of respondents to the First Investigation indicated that prices for the supply of lead sulphate are similar across the EEA. In addition, the majority of participants confirmed that lead smelters can purchase lead sulphate from suppliers from all over the world.\n\nMoreover, several participants explained that Europe is a net exporter of lead sulphate. In particular, all participants to the First Investigation confirmed that imports into the EEA represent less than 20% of the volumes consumed in the EEA. Among them, the majority estimates that imports represent around 10% of the EEA market.\n\nThis is consistent with the data submitted by the Parties and other market participants, which confirm that lead is a low value and bulky product for which transport costs are significant. For instance, as one lead smelter explained: \u2018the market for lead sulphate [is] no broader than the EEA, as this product (at least in its regular quality) does not travel much, due to the high transportation costs and also because of its moisture content (there is a moisture limit for transportation by ship\u2019.\n\nIn any event, for the purpose of this Decision, it can be left open whether the market of lead sulphate is global or EEA-wide, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts under any market definition that the Commission considers plausible. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Decision, the Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction under the narrowest plausible geographic market definition, i.e. at EEA level."

    "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission found that lead metal constitutes a distinct product market from lead concentrates and from other refined metals. The Commission also previously considered whether it would be appropriate to define separate product markets for each grade of lead metal (99.99%, 99.985% and 99.97% purity grade lead metal), in particular for applications that set higher requirements in terms of lead purity input.\n\nWhile ultimately leaving the question open, the Commission also considered a distinction between lead metal alloys and lead metal. Finally, the Commission rejected a distinction according to the feedstock used for the production of lead, i.e. lead made from concentrates (primary lead) and recycled lead (secondary lead).\n\nThe Parties do not contest that similar conclusions may also apply in this case. Therefore, the Parties presented information on the market for lead as a distinct product market from other metals, as well as for the different purity grades of lead metal.\n\nDuring the Second Investigation, the majority of respondents indicated that there are significant differences between grades, in particular as regards the applications they are used for. The majority of respondents explained that while not all customers purchase all types of lead metal, customers cannot change the grade of lead they use for the purpose of their activities. For some specific niche applications (e.g. optical glas, submarine cables) only 99.99% purity lead can be used. Lower grade (99.985% purity or less) accounts for the large majority of overall demand, roughly around 90%. This grade of lead is mostly used for the production of batteries.\n\nAs regards the difference between lead metal and lead metal alloys, the responses to the market investigations show that there are significant differences between lead metal and lead metal alloys, particularly in terms of chemical composition (e.g. calcium or antimony content) . Besides, the investigations did not elicit any result that would justify distinguishing primary and secondary lead metal.\n\nIn any event, given that the Transaction does not give rise to serious doubts under any plausible product market definition, the Commission considers that it can be left open whether the market for lead metal should be subsegmented according to purity grade. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Decision, the Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction under all plausible product market definitions, i.e. on separate markets for lead metal with a distinction by grade (i.e. 99.99%, 99.985%, 99.97% and lower)."

According to a majority of customers, CTS for indirect employee shareholding are typically sourced separately from different providers and based on different tenders than CTS for direct employee shareholding. Customers explained that this is because CTS for indirect employee shareholding require different management services and are provided by suppliers dealing with employee savings, such as Amundi and Natixis Interepargne, who are dedicated to this activity and do not provide CTS for direct employee shareholding or for investor shareholding. Indirect employee shareholders do not hold shares directly in the company as direct employee shareholders, but own units in an investment vehicle. The market investigation results were inconclusive regarding whether CTS providers are generally able to provide and whether they generally provide CTS for both direct and indirect employee shareholding and whether a company providing CTS for direct employee shareholding would be able to start providing for indirect employee shareholding. In any event, the JV will not be active in the provision of CTS for indirect employee shareholding.

As regards demand-side substitutability, a clear majority of both customers and competitors consider that CTS requirements of listed companies differ materially from those of unlisted companies in terms of, e.g. regulatory framework, complexity of the services, and IT tools requirements . Customers explained that \u201c[l]isted companies are more complex to handle in terms of regulations, number of shareholders \u201d, \u201c[r]egulations applicable to listed companies are much more stringent and more complex \u201d, \u201c[l]isted companies are subject to specific and complex regulatory environment (that does not apply in full to unlisted companies) which is necessary for a CTS provider to perfectly know and manage \u201d, and that \u201c[\u2026] listed companies have a larger number of shareholders, which generates needs in IT tools, human resources and expertise (for example regarding equity or tax matters) .\u201d In light of this, listed companies would not consider obtaining CTS for investor shareholding from a provider that does not have material experience with listed companies , because a proven track record with listed companies and solid knowledge of applicable regulation are considered important factors to source CTS for listed companies in France . Listed customers explained that \u201c[e]xperience of stock market regulations is a \"must have\" when considering a CTS provider,\u201d \u201c[we] select our providers on such sensitive topics based on their credentials and would trust only providers whose core activity is with listed companies ,\u201d \u201c[d]ealing with listed companies requires specialist skills and proven experience ,\u201d and \u201c[ we] [n]eed to have full confidence in the CTS provider .\u201d Furthermore, a few customers pointed to the riskiness of engaging a provider without significant experience with listed companies, explaining that \u201c[\u2026] obtaining CTS for investor shareholding from a CTS provider without material experience with listed companies is very risky, \u201d \u201c[a]s a listed company we do not take any risk relating to the management of our shareholders ,\u201d and \u201c[a]s a listed company, [we] can not take the risk of any issue related to the management of its share capital .\u201d As regards supply-side substitutability, the market investigation showed that providers of CTS for investor shareholding serving only unlisted companies would not be able to start serving listed companies within a short period of time and without significant investments in IT infrastructure and human capital.

The Commission\u2019s investigation revealed that, although CTS for investor shareholding and CTS for direct employee shareholding are similar with respect to, e.g. the organisation or general meetings and registrar services , CTS for direct employee shareholding require more direct engagement from the CTS personnel and more specific advisory services (e.g. tax). As one customer explained: \u201cAlthough [CTS for direct employee shareholding and CTS for investor shareholding] [are] considered as two different services, the provision of CTS services to general shareholders and employee shareholders are understood as equivalent in nature and workflow. [\u2026] The only difference between these two kinds of services is the significant assistance provided to employee shareholders, having more specific demands (e.g. asking more direct questions to [the customer\u2019s] in-house team) and often being subject to specific tax regimes that require blocking and/or specific tracking of the employee\u2019s shares .\u201d Another customer explained that \u201call CTS actors have dedicated teams for managing employee shareholders: global standard operations are processed by the standard teams and specific employee shareholders processes are handled by the dedicated teams working in liaison with the Issuer\u2019s HR Teams. \u201d Another customer indicates \u201c For direct holding of shares (of a dedicated group employing the employees), there is little to no difference between an on-employee and an employee shareholder in the management of account, [\u2026] Even if issuers are both clients of those CTS providers, those activities are managed via different tenders, offers and processes \u201d. Further, a majority of customers stated that they source CTS related to investor shareholding and CTS related to employee shareholding together from the same supplier , while some said they do not . However, customer feedback was inconclusive as to whether customers source these services based on the same or different tenders. It appears from the Commission\u2019s investigation that some of the Parties\u2019 customers for CTS related to investor shareholding do not source CTS for direct employee shareholding from the Parties or they do not source CTS for direct employee shareholding at all . As regards supply-side substitutability, a majority of competitors responding to the Commission\u2019s market investigation consider that the provision of CTS for investor shareholding and CTS for employee shareholding require different tools and/or skills . However, most respondents consider that CTS providers are generally able to provide both CTS for investor shareholding and CTS for direct employee shareholding . A slight majority of competitors consider it possible for a company providing only CTS for employee shareholding to be able to start providing CTS for investor shareholding (and vice versa) within a short period of time and without a significant investment , whereas nearly as large a number of competitors considered this would not be possible."

Specifically, as regards the in-house provision of CTS for listed companies, some companies currently in-source some of their CTS. However, listed customers that currently source CTS from an external provider consistently do not consider switching to performing CTS in-house as a realistic possibility. This is because in-house provision would require large and continuous investments in IT infrastructure and the hiring of a full team with relevant experience. Furthermore, an in-house CTS department would likely still need to rely on certain (e.g. IT) services provided by a third party. Therefore, for the purposes of the product market definition, in-house sourcing of CTS will not be considered as part of the relevant product market. The relevance of in-house sourcing of CTS to the competitive assessment will be further detailed below in Section 6.1.2.2 ."

    "topic": "Development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas",
    "text": "In its decisional practice, the Commission has generally considered a separate market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas where large upstream producers and exporters tend to sell large volumes of gas to downstream wholesalers/importers. The Commission has also considered whether this market should encompass the upstream wholesale supply of liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d), but ultimately left this question open.\nThe Notifying Party submits that, as a result of the current geopolitical events, LNG has become a perfect substitute for natural gas via pipeline both in the EEA and Italy, and should therefore be considered as part of the overall market for upstream wholesale supplies of natural gas.\nIn defining whether two products belong to the same relevant product market, the Commission will typically assess whether there is demand and supply substitution for the products in question. The assessment of demand substitution entails a determination of the range of products, which are viewed as substitutes by the consumer. Supply substitution may be taken into account in situations where its effects are equivalent to those of demand substitution, namely when suppliers are able to switch production to the relevant products and market them in the short term without incurring significant additional costs.\nThe results of the market investigation confirm the Commission\u2019s practice to consider a separate market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas. The clear majority of operators in the upstream and downstream wholesale supply of natural gas confirmed that such a distinction is appropriate. As one respondent notes in this regard, \u201c[i]n Italy the supply and import of natural gas is a distinct activity [from] the resale of the commodity to final users. Consequently, the distinction between upstream wholesale and downstream wholesale is still valid\u201d.\nWith regard to whether the market should encompass both natural gas in gaseous form and LNG, the results of the market investigation were mixed.\nConsidering demand substitution, while the majority of customers on the upstream wholesale market source both natural gas and LNG, many view the two products as complementary rather than substitutable. This is mainly because of the differences in the supply structure, the import infrastructure involved and logistics between the procurement of gas in gaseous form and LNG. As one respondent submits, \u201cLNG can be sourced from a wider geographical area and the amount for each transaction is large (0.1 bcm). Natural gas [in gaseous form] can be sourced from specific geographical locations and can be purchased in smaller batches\u201d.\nWith regard to supply substitution, suppliers of natural gas in gaseous form and LNG are usually not the same parties. As explained by a respondent \u201c[t]he supply of natural gas depends [on] the transport infrastructures available [in] the country of origin. Consequently, it might be the case that some countries are equipped with both export pipelines and LNG facilities meanwhile others with just one of the two (ie. Azerbaijan) \u201d. In this same regard, another respondent notes \u201c[d]epending on the geographical source of the gas and the type of supplier, upstream suppliers usually specialize in the supply of either LNG or Natural Gas [in gaseous form] \u201d.\nIn any case, the question of whether the market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas should encompass both natural gas in gaseous form and LNG can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market, irrespective of the precise market delineation. The Commission\u2019s assessment does not change depending on whether LNG is considered part of the market, as the Parties\u2019 market shares do not differ materially between the two alternative market delineations . This is shown in the Commission\u2019s prospective analysis of the likely future developments on this market, with the replacement of Russian gas supplies by alternative sources, including LNG , in paragraphs (72) et seq . below.\nAs the In Salah JV is not active in the supply of LNG, and the supplies of Eni, Sonatrach and Equinor into Italy (where, as will be explained below, the Commission focuses its analysis) are primarily in gaseous form, the Commission will analyse the effects of the Transaction under the most conservative approach, focusing its assessment on production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas in gaseous form only."

    "text": "The Commission has previously found that the downstream wholesale supply of gas is a distinct product market . On this market importers/wholesalers, which procure natural gas from major producers, sell gas volumes to other resellers/distributors (wholesale supply), which in turn supply end-customers (retail supply), and may also sell directly to large end-customers.\nThe Commission has further considered, and has ultimately left the question open in its decisional practice, whether gas trading on hubs should be included in the market for the downstream wholesale supply of natural gas. A gas hub is an instrument, which facilitates exchanges of gas amongst market players in order to allow buyers and sellers to find sufficient volume for supply or demand exceeding the capacities in the short term. At gas hubs, gas producers, downstream gas wholesalers and retailers as well as certain industrial customers can both physically as well as financially trade gas. The hub can be either physical in nature or a virtual trading point.\nThe Notifying Party submits that the downstream gas wholesale model in Italy offers traders two ways to buy and sell gas, namely either through over-the-counter, bilateral contracts with delivery at the Punto di Scambio Virtuale (PSV) or through transactions on the regulated exchange managed by the Gestore dei Mercati Energetici (GME). In bilateral, over the counter sales, trading partners are generally in direct contact with each other or make use of a broker, and agreements on trading volumes and pricing are reached individually and bilaterally among the parties. Sales on regulated exchanges are, by contrast, cleared and settled by a central counterparty, usually an exchange platform, and subject to standard contracts for standard volumes. According to the Notifying Party, the market for the downstream wholesale supply of gas in Italy should encompass both contracts with delivery point at the PSV, and transactions on the regulated exchange managed by GME.\nThe results of the market investigation confirm that the Commission\u2019s decision practice is still relevant. A clear majority of respondents submit that the Commission\u2019s practice of considering a separate market for the downstream wholesale supply of gas is appropriate . As one respondent explains, \u201c[t]he downstream wholesale market indeed covers the activities of reselling the gas at either the downstream wholesale level or the retail level \u201d.\nThe Commission further investigated whether it would be relevant to draw a distinction between whether the gas traded in the downstream wholesale market originated from LNG or natural gas in gaseous form . The market investigation clarified that such a distinction is not relevant for the downstream wholesale supply of natural gas. One respondent explains in this regard \u201conce the gas is on the Italian network, there is no difference between gas originating from gas in gaseous form or LNG \u201d, while another respondent explains that there are no differences in pricing, as \u201c[o]nce the gas entered into the Italian transmission grid, the reference price is the PSV\u201d.\nLastly, the majority of all respondents submit that in Italy, the market for the downstream wholesale supply of gas consists of both bilateral transactions over the counter with delivery point at the PSV, and trading on the regulated exchange platform managed by GME . The majority of both suppliers and purchasers in the Italian downstream wholesale supply market submit that they engage in both types of transactions. In any case, the question whether bilateral transactions over the counter with delivery point at the PSV, and trading on the regulated exchange platform managed by GME belong to the same market can be left open, as Eni\u2019s market shares would be close to identical under any alternative market delineation.\nThe Commission will therefore conduct the assessment of the Transaction considering a market for the downstream wholesale supply of natural gas, without distinguishing further between (i) natural gas in gaseous form and natural gas that originated from LNG, and (ii) between bilateral, over the counter gas supply contracts with delivery point at the PSV and transactions on the regulated exchange managed by GME."

In the most recent case relating to the Transmediterranean pipeline connecting the Italian transmission grid with the production fields in Algeria, the market investigation was inconclusive and the Commission left open whether international pipelines and regasification terminals belong to the same relevant product market. The Commission further considered whether the Transmediterranean pipeline is a natural monopoly, since it is the only pipeline connecting the Italian transmission grid to the Algerian production fields. However, the Commission eventually left this question open and conducted its analysis considering, on a precautionary basis, that the Transmediterranean pipeline belongs to the overall market for gas import infrastructure, while also considering the narrower potential market for international gas pipelines.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest the Commission\u2019s previous findings.\nThe results of the market investigation do not provide reasons for the Commission to depart from the findings in its recent decisions. For the purposes of this decision and in line with its findings in its most recent case relating to the Transmediterranean pipeline, the Commission will conduct its assessment under the narrowest potential market definition, considering the Transmediterranean pipeline as a natural monopoly for the import of Algerian gas into Italy."

    "text": "The Commission has previously found the market for upstream wholesale supplies of natural gas to potentially comprise the EEA, as well as at least imports from Algeria and Russia . In some decisions concerning specific regional areas, the Commission has found that the market could be narrower in scope, i.e. either regional (i.e. encompassing several Member States) or national in scope, where there was limited interconnection infrastructure or a lack of available cross-border capacity.\nThe Notifying Party submits that the geographic scope of the market should encompass the EEA, including exports from third countries into the EEA.\nThe results of the market investigation indicate that, from a supply side, the geographic scope of the market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas is narrower than the EEA. In order to supply their gas, undertakings on this market depend on the available gas transport infrastructure, connecting their production fields with the downstream markets. As a respondent explains, upstream gas wholesalers will supply their gas to the regions where there is the necessary infrastructure in place, to accommodate for the gas shipments: \u201c[d]ue to the nature of pipelines which tend to be point-to-point, suppliers which rely on pipelines to provide gas in gaseous form supply to points where pipeline networks can deliver (\u2026)\u201d. Gas production fields, however, are typically not connected through transport pipelines with each part of the EEA. Furthermore, the Commission received indications that limited interconnection infrastructure or lack of available cross-border capacity still exist within at least parts of the EEA, limiting flows of gas within the EEA .\nSince, as will be explained further below, the activities of both the In Salah JV and Eni on the market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of gas concern Italy, the Commission focused its market investigation on Italy .\nWith regard to the demand side, the majority of respondents in Italy who procure gas from the upstream wholesale market submit that they do so on an EEA-or-wider basis. Regarding the countries outside the EEA, where the majority of respondents in Italy submits to source gas from, the most frequently mentioned are Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Russia and for LNG, Qatar.\nAs is evidenced by the origin of the composition of gas imported and consumed in Italy, supplies of gas in gaseous form to Italy primarily originate outside the EEA, and in particular in Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Russia, as well as within the EEA, primarily Norway . It follows that transport infrastructure is in place that enables upstream production and wholesale suppliers to sell gas from Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Russia and Norway to the Italian gas network.\nIn light of the above, the Commission will conduct its analysis on the basis of a market that comprises upstream wholesale supplies of natural gas in gaseous form into Italy, including exports to Italy from Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya and Russia."

In some instances, the Commission has considered whether several gas hubs (located in different Member States) could be considered as part of the same geographic market, for reasons of price convergence, leaving however the question open.\nThe Notifying Party submits that, because European gas hubs are increasingly interconnected, with a growing number of physical connections and bi-directional supply flows, there is increased liquidity and price convergence across the EEA and that, therefore, the geographic market is wider than national.\nResponses to the market investigation were not conclusory regarding a wider than national geographic market. Some actors on this market submit that they could acquire gas directly from downstream wholesale markets of adjacent countries (e.g. Austria, Switzerland) for their requirements in Italy. However, the majority of all respondents who provided a definite answer submit that less than 15% of the gas that is traded on the Italian downstream wholesale market (i.e. through PSV and GME) is further exported, in order to cover demand outside Italy, which suggests that gas flows across a region wider than national remain limited. Conversely, inasmuch, the results of the market investigation suggest that the market for downstream wholesale supply of gas with regard to Italy is at least national in scope.\nIn any case, the exact geographic scope of the market can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition. For the purposes of this decision, the Commission will conduct the assessment on the narrowest potential geographic scope, considering the market for downstream wholesale supply of natural gas in Italy to be national in scope."

Indeed, the customer base for these two products is not the same: customers of PA6.6 BP are typically compounders producing PA6.6 EP, whereas customers of PA6.6 EP are typically producing PA6.6 EP -based part s for various downstream applications such as for example automotive. This shows that these two products are not really substitutable, and indeed, on the demand side, a majority of customers consider that they cannot be used interchangeably. One customer  explains that \u201c PA66 EP is formulated accordingly the different application needs, PA66 BP is used to produce PA66 EP \u201d. Furthermore, on the supply side, a majority of competitors outlined that they would not be able to switch their production of PA6.6 BP to that of PA6.6 EP, and vice versa. Indeed, these are vastly different production processes : the production of PA6.6 BP is more capital intensive than that of PA6.6 EP, and the production of PA6.6 EP is technically less complicated. According  to the  Parties, setting up a new compounding line would typically cost $3.5 to $6.5 million and take 10 to 18 months. Setting up a polymerization line, on the other hand, would typically cost $70 to $150 million, depending  on the technology chosen and would take 30 t o 50 months . Furthermore, polymerisation is a chemical rea ction, whereas compounding is a mixing process.

    "text": "In commercial viticulture, grape vines are mainly used to produce  grapes for  wine or to produce table grapes ready for consumption. T he Targets breed and license only table grape vine varieties. The Commission considers that table grape vines and wine grape vines belong to two separate product markets. From  the demand side  persp ective , as highlighted by the Parties, the product characteristics are materially different  between table and wine grape vines  in respect to: (i) growing climate conditions (wine grape vines are more resistant to different climate conditions whereas table grape vines are suited for warm and dry climates  only); (ii) sweetness  (wine grape  vines need to produce grapes containing more sugar which is used for the creation of alcohol whereas table grapes with high level of sugar may deteriorate faster) ; (iii) pre sence of seeds, thick skin and size (wine grape vines should produce grapes with seeds, thick skin and small size; all characteristics valued in the production of wine whereas customers of table grapes value the  opposite characteristics, i.e. seedless, thi n skin and big size ); (iv) yield and revenue (wine grape vines normally produce around half the volume of grapes which are sold at a lower price  in comparison to table grapes vines). From a supply side perspective  as well,  all differences discussed above imply a limited supply -side substitutability. Breeders cannot promptly and effectively use wine grape vine varieties to produce grape vine varieties with the specific characteristics demanded by downstream customers . This is confirmed by more than one breeder that  have either tried and abandoned the use of wine grape vine varieties in their table grape program, or have been trying for more than 8 years to develop a variety that combines one characteristic of wine grape vines (i.e. its antioxidant properties) with the desired characteristics for table grapes. The market investigation supported this finding as breeders confirmed that traits characteristic of table grape vines and opposite to those of wine grape vines (e.g. production of grapes that are crunchy, seedless, with thin skin, and log shelf live) are the traits of their most successful grape varieties with table grape growers  as well as the targeted traits in their breeding activities targeting these customers . The fact that competitive dynamics are specific to each of these products is also reflected by internal documents. The Parties in the ordinary course of business monitor how traits specific to table grape vines and not relevant for wine grape vines are ref lected in recent product launches by their competitors ."

    "text": "Although both Targets currently license almost exclusively seedless table grape vine varieties, the Commission assessed  whether the product market includes both seeded and seed less table grape vines. On the demand side, growers\u2019 decision on whether to plant seeded or seedless table grape vines is primarily driven by the preferences of the final consum ers downstream who value the different organoleptic characteristics of seedless grapes. The consumers\u2019 preference for seedless grapes has increased over time and is expected to increase further resulting in a clear market trend towards the progressive repl acement of seeded varieties with seedless varieties and pointing towards the limited substitutability between seedless and seeded table grape vine varieties. The market investigation supports this finding as the majority of growers consider the consumers\u2019 preference for seedless grapes as the main differentiating factor between seedless and seeded table grape vine varieties. In addition, the Parties\u2019 estimates of new hectares planted in the EEA show the already small [5 -10]% share of seeded varieties in 2 020 drop to [0 -5]% in 2022. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of market players interviewed expect the consumers\u2019 demand for seedless grapes to grow further. However, should the shift in consumers\u2019 preference for seedless grapes stop in the future  or point towards seeded grapes, there are no other intrinsic differences between seedless and seeded vine grape varieties that would limit demand -side substitutability. The vast majority of respondents to the  market investigation noted that growers can easily switch between new plantings of seedless and of seeded table grape vines. In addition, according to the majority of the growers, in general, seedless and seeded vines can be very similar in terms of yield, costs, stability, durability and difficulty to grow . On the supply side, substitutability is limited because breeders willing to start providing seedless varieties would need to undergo a lengthy process . Creating a seedless variety  can take several years due to the required successive cross- breeding and the time needed for vines to grow and develop, while it is not technically possible to speed up breeding cycles. However , it is worth noting that due to the consumers\u2019 preference  for seedless grapes (making seedless varieties an economically attractive growth opportunity) both public institutions and private breeders (from international breeders like the Targets, to local cooperatives of growers) either are already breeding and li censing seedless varieties or are ready to enter the market in the near future with new seedless varieties. Competitors noted that it takes between eight and 15 years to create a new variety. However, they also clarified that their current most successfu l varieties are seedless and that they have on average five other varieties under development that they expect to commercialize within the next five to ten years. In this industry such timeframe can still be considered reasonable given that grape vines are expected to begin yielding fruit in two to three years after they are planted and then be productive for an additional 22 to 23 years. Although the market investigation indicated that seedless table grape vine varieties are differentiated from seede d table grape vine varieties, f or the purpose of this Decision, it can be left open whether the product market includes both seeded and seedless table grape vine varieties since the Transaction would not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with th e internal market even under the narrowest plausible market definition, i.e. breeding and licensing of seedless table grape vine varieties."

    "text": "Although both Targets currently li cense almost exclusively seedless protected table grape vine varieties, the Commission assessed whether the product market includes both protected and public table grape vines. On the demand side, growers\u2019 decision on whether to plant protected or public table grape vines is driven by both product differences valued by grow ers as well as the preferences of the final consumers downstream. This is because, in order to obtain a return on their investment through plant variety protection, private breeders and public institutions invest in R&D aiming to enhance certain grape vine varieties for characteristics that are preferred by growers (e.g. yield, durability, stability) and organoleptic characteristics of grapes preferred by final consumers (e.g. flavour, crunchiness, uniformit y, size). Although these differences seem to indicate a limited demand- side substitutability between protected and public grape vine varieties, this is mitigated by public varieties\u2019 lower prices and wider accessibility as well as by the growers\u2019 ability t o switch. The market investigation supported this finding as the majority of growers consider that public grape vine varieties have, in general, lower yield, lower stability and durability. The majority of respondents also acknowledge that final custome rs prefer protected varieties. However, respondents to the market investigation noted that growers can easily switch between new plantings of protected and of public table grape vines . In addition, according to the majority of the growers, in general, protected varieties have higher yield and durability whereas public varieties cost less and are more easily accessible. On the supply side, substitutability is limited because a currently public variety cannot be protected and because breeders willing to provide protected varieties would need to undergo a lengthy process. Given that breeders can apply for protection only for new varieties, creating a new variety that can be protected takes  several years due to the required successive cross- breeding and the time needed for vines to grow and develop, while it is not technically possible to speed up breeding cycles. However , it is worth noting that, due to the consumers\u2019 preference for grapes from protected varieties as well as the current market trend pushing growers to value and pay for protected varieties, public institutions that used to create new varieties and make them public are starting to protect their new varieties or are partnering with private entities (cooperatives of growers or companies) , blurring the line between public and private breeders . This is acknowledged by the Parties, for several public institutions  who have recently been active with licensing of protected varieties, and confirmed by the market investigation.  Competitors noted that it takes between eight and 15 years to create a new variety. Historically public institutions that could have developed public varieties noted that they have on average five other varieties under development for which they expect to apply for EU-wide protect ion with the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO ) within the next five to ten years. In this industry such timeframe can  still be considered reasonable given that grape vines are expected to begin yielding fruit in two to thr ee years after they are planted and then be productive for an additional 22 to 23 years. Although there are indications that protected table grape vine varieties are differentiated from public table grape vine varieties, the Commission considers that for the purpose of this Decision, it can be left open whether the product market includes both protected and public table grape vine varieties since the Transaction would not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market even under the  narrowest plausible market definition, i.e. breeding and licensing of seedless protected  table grape vine varieties."

    "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission considered the question whether the market for gas import infrastructure could be sub -segmented between (i) regasification services for the import of LNG  (i.e. for the import of gas in liquefied form)  and (ii) international pipelines  (i.e. for the import of gas in gaseous form) . The Commission ultimately left open the exact market definition.\n\nThe Notifying Parties submit that international pipelines constitute a separate product market from regasification terminals.\n\nThe results of the market investigation conducted in the present case were inconclusive on whether regasification terminals and pipelines are substitutable.\n\nWith regard to demand -side substitutability, the responses of customers were split, with a slight majority of those who provided a definite answer not considering the two types of gas import infrastructure as substitutable. A majority of  customers who provided a definite answer submitted that the differences in the regulatory and operational aspects between  regasification terminals  and international pipelines affect their substitutability from the demand side . Respondents pointed specifically to the fact that, although both types of infrastructures ultimately deliver the same gas molecule to the market, they have different transport structures and logistics, whose associated risks differ accordingly. Thus, the decision to import gas in gaseous form  via international pipelines or as LNG  that requires regasification is part of the initial economic assessment of gas importers, and is a choice made for the long term. Gas importers cannot switch between pipelines and regasification terminals in a cost- and time -efficient manner due to the fact that the choice of the gas import infrastructure is defined by the upstream gas or LNG supply contract. Further, the market investigation indicated that, while all customers import gas in gaseous form through international pipelines, less than half also import gas in liquefied form through regasification terminals.\n\nMoreover, the results of the market investigation indicate that there is no substitution on the supply side between the provision of regasification services through LNG terminals and the provision of gas transport services through international pipelines in Italy. In fact, apart from SNAM, no other operator of a gas import infrastructure offers both regasification services through LNG terminals and gas transport services through international pipelines.\n\nThe Commission considers that, for the purposes of this decision, it may be left open whether international pipelines and regasification terminals belong to the same relevant product market or belong to separate product markets, as the Transaction does not lead to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market, regardless of the market definition adopted. The Commission will assess the Transaction both in the context of an overall market for gas import infrastructure, comprising gas pipelines and LNG terminals, as well as in the narrowest potential market for gas pipelines."

    "topic": "Geographic Market definition regarding the Transmediterranean Pipeline",
    "text": "The results of the market investigation with regard to the substitutability between different pipelines, connecting the Italian transmission grid with different sources of gas, are open to interpretation.\n\nOn the one hand, a clear majority of both customers and competitors submitted that different pipelines are generally not interchangeable. Some of the customers replied that there could be some interchangeability between different pipelines connecting the Italian transmission grid with different spot markets in Europe, but the same would not apply when considering pipelines connected to gas production sites, such as the Transmediterranean Pipeline.\n\nRespondents noted that the lack of interchangeability from the demand side is mainly linked to the fact that different pipelines are connected to different sources of gas (i.e. specific gas production fields) . Supply contracts with production fields are in turn usually long -term. As a result, the ability of gas importers to switch import infrastructure is linked to the existence and the duration of their upstream gas supply contracts. These upstream gas supply contracts are also gas - or LNG -specific, which also defines the use of either pipelines or LNG terminals for the import into Italy .\n\nFrom the perspective of the supply -side, substitutability between pipelines is limited by the fact that usually there will be only one pipeline connecting a gas production field with the Italian transmission network. In fact, the Transmediterranean Pipeline is the only infrastructure allowing for the import of natural gas (in gaseous form) originating from the Algerian gas production fields, into Italy.\n\nOn the other hand , the majority of both customers and competitors also replied that in their view the Transmediterranean Pipeline is in fact competing with other gas import infrastructures for customers , which seems to be in contradiction with their view that different pipelines are in general not interchangeable.\n\nTaking the overall feedback into account, the Commission interprets the responses of the participants to the market investigation as follows:\nIt is clear from the overall responses that, once a gas shipper has entered into a gas -supply contract with a specific source of gas (which will be gas - or LNG -specific), the available infrastructures for importing this gas into Italy are defined. Where there is only a single pipeline connecting Italy to the specific source of gas, there can be no competition among the various pipelines from that point on.\n\nOne customer explained in this regard that, when deciding to conclude a new gas-supply contract with a source of gas, they consider all relevant factors, such as gas price, logistic costs to bring gas to Italy, the flexibility of the supply contract, reliability of the gas source etc. At this moment, the relevant sources of gas and, as an extension, the relevant infrastructures are in competition with other sources and their infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the feedback from the market investigation suggests that the choice of the import infrastructure plays only a minor role in the choice of the gas -supply contract in the upstream market. When asked to rank their criteria in deciding where to source gas from, customers ranked the price of the natural gas as the most important factor, followed by the features of the gas supply agreement, reliability of supplier and lastly the transportation tariffs and the need for portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Commission therefore understands that competition primarily takes place in the upstream market for the gas supply, and that the gas import infrastructure only plays a secondary role in the decision to source gas from one source or the other .\n\nIn any case, and given the ambiguity of the feedback from the market investigation, the Commission considers that the question whether the Transmediterranean Pipeline is to be regarded as a natural monopoly can be left open , as the Transaction does not raise concerns regardless of the precise market delineation . For the purposes of this decision the Commission will conduct the assessment under the most conservative basis , considering that the Transmediterranean Pipeline does not constitute a monopoly and will consider a market covering other import infrastructures as well, whether both regasification terminals and international pipelines, or international pipelines alone."

A majority of both customers and competitors submit ted that installation of third rail systems is not offered by installers of catenaries and overhead c ontact lines . This is because know-how and required equipment differs, and third -lines are carried out by track installers , rather than catenary installers . As one competitor noted, \u201c[t]here is a big difference in equipment and know -how between laying trac ks (track) and placing overhead contact lines installations (catenary). The concerned workforce requires very divers skills.\u201d Furthermore, as third -rail systems are typically used in underground railways, while catenaries and overhead contact lines are p rimarily used in above -ground railways , both systems serve a different purpose and are not sourced together .\nThe results of the market investigation were , however , inconclusive on whether the market for the installation and maintenance of catenaries and overhead contact lines should be further segmented by type of customer, i.e. between long -distance and metropolitan rail. A majority of customers responded that inst allers of catenaries and overhead contact lines for long -distance rail can also provide their services for metropolitan rail, and vice versa. However, many respondents explain ed that while the technical principles applicable to both segments are the same, the long -distance rail segment is more demanding in terms of certifications and the necessary installation equipment, and there might also be different training requirements for the personnel. Furthermore, as long -distance rail is typically operated by t he national railway infrastructure operator, while metropolitan rail is typically operated by the urban railway infrastructure operator s, customers are not the same for installation and maintenance services in long -distance rail and metropolitan rail.\nThe Commission has further assessed whether within the potential segment for long-distance rail a further distinction between con ventional rail and high -speed rail would be warranted. The results of the market investigation showed that such a distinction is n ot necessary. The majority of both customers and competitors noted that service providers are able to provide installation and maintenance for both conve ntional long -distance rail and high -speed rail. Although some respondents point ed to some differ ences in the installation, most of them also noted that it is the same service providers who are active in the installation and maintenance of catenaries and overhead contact lines for both conventional and high -speed rail and that they serve the same customers . One competitor explained that such differences in the installation exist between all kinds of different types of catenaries (such as catenaries for use under bridges etc.) The Commission therefore does not consider that such differences justify the defin ition of a separate product market.\nIn light of the above , the Commission will assess the Transaction on the basis of a market comprising the provision of both installation and maintenance services for catenaries and overhead contact lines, excluding thir d rail systems , with a particular focus on long -distance rail . Further distinction s within long -distance rail , such as between conventional and high -speed rail do not change the Commission\u2019s assessment . As the Parties are not active in the instal lation and maintenance of third rail systems, this market will not be further assessed."

Finally, in the absence of specific relevant weight ranges within general aviation and business jets, the Commission considers that there is no need to define separate markets.

    "topic": "High-speed Rolling Stock",
    "text": "The Parties consider that there is a single overall product market for high-speed trains operating at speeds of 250 km/h and above and that trains capable of speeds at or above 300 km/h (\u2018very\u2019 high-speed rolling stock) do not constitute a separate market.\nFirst, the Notifying Party states that the same regulations apply to all trains capable of speeds at or above 250 km/h. In that regard, it indicates that EU legislation and policy documents only provide definition and specific technical requirements for trains capable of speeds at or above 250 km/h, without specific references to trains capable of speeds at or above 300 km/h.\nAccording to the Notifying Party, once requirements for speeds of 250 km/h are met, most technical requirements do not differ between high-speed and very high-speed trains. Any additional technical requirements (and any related costs) for reaching speeds above 300 km/h are incremental and are obtained through an extension of the same technology.\nSecond, the Notifying Party states that high-speed rolling stock suppliers can develop new platforms or adapt existing platforms to allow for higher speeds. High-speed rolling stock suppliers can thus rely on their technical know-how and capacity to develop trains operating at higher speeds.\nIn that regard, the Notifying Party submits that the speed increase does not require significant technical modifications. Operating speed only impacts a few components and sub-components, requiring replacement or adaptation in line with the new speed, and which represent a negligible part of the total platform costs. In addition, the overall trainset architecture and the interior do not need to be changed, saving rolling stock suppliers significant cost and time. Furthermore, the Notifying Party considers that R&D investment to convert a high-speed platform into a very high-speed one is limited and a supplier having developed a 250 km/h solution may participate in a very high-speed tender with very little upfront investment.\nThird, the Notifying Party considers that tender specifications and infrastructure costs do not provide a basis for distinguishing between high-speed and very high-speed trains.\nIn particular, the Notifying Party claims that trains with maximum speeds below 300 km/h can compete in tenders for trains capable of speeds of 300 km/h or above. Conversely, trains capable of running at speeds above 300 km/h may compete in tenders for trains operating between 250 -300 km/h. In that regard, the Notifying Party indicates that multiple suppliers use the same platform in both high-speed and very high-speed tenders.\nThe Notifying Party further states that customers for high-speed trains do not use 300 km/h as a relevant threshold. In that regard, it indicates that maximum speed is often not the main factor of choice for high-speed operators and that customers sometimes express their requirement in journey time rather than in terms of maximum speed. In addition, certain customers are interested in flexible rolling stock solutions with platforms capable of high-speed and very high-speed.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the Notifying Party considers that the Commission\u2019s findings in its decision in case M.8677 - Siemens/Alstom (hereinafter \u2018Siemens/Alstom \u2019) regarding the specific characteristics of tracks allowing for very high-speed travel and having higher construction costs are insufficient to warrant a distinction between high-speed and very high-speed trains. In that regard, it states that there is no general difference in construction costs between high-speed and very high-speed dedicated tracks, because each line has specific geographic and other considerations that may have an important impact on construction costs. Moreover, it states that there is a certain level of substitutability between tracks dedicated to high and very high-speeds, since several trains that are not capable of speeds of 300 km/h or above are operating on very high-speed tracks across the EEA.\nBased on the above, according to the Notifying Party, the question of a speed threshold within the high-speed market is not a decisive issue from both supplier and customer perspectives.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party considers that the question of a potential segmentation of the market between high-speed and very high-speed trains can be left open as the competitive conditions do not change materially regardless of the market definition."

In addition, it states that while many suppliers may only offer one type of traction and/or architecture, this does not prevent them from competing in tenders against suppliers whose offerings are based on different traction systems or architecture.\nWith respect to number of floors, the Notifying Party indicates that most tenders do not include any specifications related to single - or double -deck high -speed trains . Therefore , the Notifying Party considers that single -deck and double -deck platforms are typically perceived as substitutable from a customer standpoint and compete closely in most tenders.

    "text": "The Commission considers that the findings in relation to a possible segmentation of the high-speed rolling stock market distinguishing very high -speed trains as explained in Siemens/Alstom remain applicable for the purpose of the present decision.\nThe results of the market investigation conducted in the present case thus confirmed that high-speed trains (capable of a speed equal to or higher than 250 km/h) are not substitutable with very high -speed trains (capable of a speed equal to or higher than 300 km/h). The majority of respondents consider that very high-speed rolling stock belong to a separate market, mainly because of (i) their operational speed capacity and performance, which allow for travel at 300 km/h and above, (ii) dedicated lines used to operate them , and (iii) specific technical requirements, price and investment needed to develop such rolling stock.\nFrom the demand -side, major high -speed and very high-speed lines operators such as Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (\u2018FSI\u2019, Italy) and SNCF (France) confirmed that very high-speed rolling stock constitute a separate relevant market. SNCF explained in that regard that the condition of exploitation of high -speed and very high -speed rolling stock differ, and that trains running at speed below 300 km/h cannot be operated on very high -speed dedicated track without disturbing the service. SNCF further explained that the European Technical Standards of Interoperability ( \u2018TSI\u2019) specifications for very high -speed rolling stock do differ and are more demanding than high -speed rolling stock (requiring, for example , that mechanical parts be of greater strength for a very high -speed train than for a high -speed trains ).\nOn the other hand, some customers, including Deutsche Bahn (Germany), Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori ( \u2018NTV \u2019, Italy) and High Speed Two ( \u2018HS2\u2019, United Kingdom), consider that a distinction between high -speed and very high -speed rolling stock may not be warranted. They indicated that they operate both kinds of fleets and consider that technical requirements for running high -speed and very high -speed do not significantly differ .\nHowever, these customers also recognised that they have a specific demand for very high-speed rolling stock and that they would not procure a high -speed train to be operated on very high -speed tracks. This is because the procurement of a very high-speed train aims at maximising the performance allowed by the railway infrastructure, which would not be possible with a high -speed train. For instance, HS2 indicated that investments in very high -speed dedicated tracks aim to \u2018HS2 Ltd is procuring very high -speed rolling stock capable of 360km/h operation on infrastructure designed for 360km/h operation. This is to maximise the capacity benefits of the [very] high-speed infrastructure and achieve HS2 Ltd\u2019s Sponsor Requirements (set by the UK Department for Transport). \u2019 This is consistent with the Commission\u2019s findings in Siemens/Alstom , where investments in very high -speed dedicated tracks were found to rely on major policy decisions and to involve substantial public spending in order to specifically achieve speeds that only very high-speed trains can achieve.\nFrom the supply -side, a large majority of rolling stock suppliers agree that multiple factors justify distinguishing high-speed and very high -speed rolling stock markets .\nFirst, high-speed and very high -speed trains differ in performance. As stated in Siemens/Alstom , very high -speed trains are designed to travel long distances at speeds over 300 km/h (other high-speed trains are designed to travel at speeds between 250 km/h and cannot reach 300 km/h) . In order to achieve speeds above 300 km/h, suppliers explained that very high -speed trains need specific technological development , such as sophisticated aerodynamics, and strict safety requirement, such crash tests. In addition, respondents explained that the design and manufacture of a very high -speed train require a specific combination of special pre -calculations and laboratory tests prior to performing track tests.\nSecond , respondents to the market investigation indicated that customers generally specify the speed required ( i.e., at least 300 km/h in a very high-speed tender). In certain cases, customers request bidders to have a certified very high -speed platform in order to be capable to participate in the tender.\nThird , as a results of the above, the technical and commercial development of a very high-speed platform with certified technology require more than 10 years and very significant investments , significantly higher than those needed to develop a high -speed platform.\nIt follows from the above that very high -speed rolling stock appear to constitute a distinct relevant market. However, it is not necessary to conclude on the precise delineation of the relevant product market for the assessment of the effects of the Transaction for the purpose of the present decision . For the reasons set out at paragraphs (281) , the Commission will focus its competitive assessment on the market for very high -speed (including all trains capable of a speed equal to or higher than 300 km/h)."

The defining feature of mainline trains is their self -propelled nature, meaning that power is distributed through several motors along the train. As a result, mainline trains can accommodate passengers in all cars and do not have dedicated vehicles with no passenger access (such as locomotives) at the front and end of the train that provide the pull. The traction can be powered through different sources, including, among others, by drawing power from overhead catenaries to power electrical multiple units ( \u2018EMUs \u2019) or by on -board diesel -engines (diesel multiple units ( \u2018DMUs \u2019)).\nMainline trains are distinct from high-speed trains (running at speeds at or above 250 km/h) and urban trains running on urban networks and covering mass transit within cities."

    "text": "The Notifying Party indicates that , as established by the Commission in Siemens/Alstom, mainline trains differ from high -speed trains on the basis of regulatory and technical differences related to maximum speed. It explains that trains travelling at or above 250 km/h must respect additional technical specifications under the TSI. Nevertheless, in the Notifying Party\u2019s view, it cannot be excluded that future intercity tenders will not be constrained by competition from 250 km/h high -speed trains . The Notifying Party argues that although high -speed and intercity trains are not part of the same market, high -speed trains can be offered for intercity tenders as long as they meet the customer\u2019s tender requirements (including those related to price) and that high -speed trains can be authorised , and therefore operated, at speeds below 250 km/h.\nThe Notifying Party submits that mainline trains differ from metros due to the network on which they operate. While metros operate on closed urban mass transit networks, mainline trains operate on mainline networks covering transport between city centers and suburban areas, different cities, regions, and countries. Moreover, mainline trains are characterized by higher speeds, less frequent stops, lower passenger capacity, and higher comfort level compared to metros.\nThe Notifying Party considers that there is no clear segmentation between regional and intercity trains based on supply -side characteristics but that there may be certain differences from a demand -side perspective.\nThe Notifying Party puts forward a number of arguments against distinguishing regional from intercity trains, including the absence of any commonly accepted industry definition and the substitutability of product lines between regional and intercity trains from a supply -side perspective. In particular, the Notifying Party asserts that all major players are already active in both markets. The remaining regional -only suppliers can easily expand into the intercity market in view of the limited technical and regulatory differences between regional and intercity trains.\nFurthermore, the Notifying Party argues that suppliers can upgrade regional trains for operation at intercity speeds with limited costs. The Notifying Party explains that intercity speeds are often already incorporated into the pre -design of regional trains.\nIn relation to the distinction between EMUs and DMUs, the Notifying Party recognises that they may constitute separate product markets. The Notifying Party also explains that new technologies are emerging, including bimode trains which operate on routes consisting of both electrified and non -electrified lines within a single journey without stops or changes by switching between electrical traction and diesel engine power. Other technologies are hydrogen fuel -cell trains that provide an emission -free alternative to DMUs on non -electrified lines, and BEMUs on the other hand, provide emission -free alternatives to bimode trains which operate on both electrified and non -electrified lines to avoid interchanges on a route.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party explains that the Parties\u2019 activities only overlap in EMUs as Bombardier has not supplied any DMU trains in the past 10 years and does not have a DMU train in its portfolio.\nIn the Notifying Party\u2019s view, single -decker and double -decker trains are not likely to constitute separate markets.\nFrom the demand -side perspective, customers\u2019 requests for tenders typically do not contain specific architecture requirements as customers tender projects based on capacity requirements and are willing to consider both single - and double -decker architectures. The Notifying Party explains that suppliers decide on the architecture of their offer taking into account customers\u2019 capacity and length requirements and infrastructural constraints (e.g., platform length), and their existing portfolio. According to the Notifying Party, on a limited number of occasions, suppliers offered different architectures in the same project.\nFrom the supply -side perspective, the Notifying Party submits that all major suppliers have single- and double -decker platforms in their portfolio. Furthermore, the Notifying Party considers that the recent trend for mixed train configuration platforms (i.e., platforms that combine both single - and double -decker cars) further blurs the distinction between single - and double -decker trains.\nThe Notifying Party submits that the competitive assessment should be carried out by combining speed (intercity/regional) and propulsion (EMU/DMU) in order to reflect commercial reality in tenders. In the Notifying Party\u2019s view, customers always specify both the maximum operating speed and power supply requirements in their tender specifications.\nThe Notifying Party indicates, nonetheless, that the market definition can be left open as the Transaction does not give rise to any competition concerns regardless of the precise delineation of the relevant market."

Therefore, for the purpose of the present decision, only trains capable of a maximum speed below 250 km/h will fall in the mainline rolling stock category.\nSecond , with regard to the distinction between self -propelled and locomotive -hauled trains, a large majority of respondents confirms that distinction. This is due to the fact that locomotive -hauled trains consist of essentially two products, wagons and a locomotive, whereas self -propelled trains consist of a single trainset involving inherently different and more sophisticated technology. Accordingly, from the demand -side, self -propelled and locomotive -hauled trains are used for different services and involve different exploitation and maintenance facilities and management."

Despite a certain degree of overlap between products in each market in terms of maximum speeds (certain regional trains being capable /operating above 160 km/h), customers consider that the distinction remains valid due to their different features (interior layout and amenities) and technical characteristics, predominantly speed but also capacity, length, number of doors, and other features.

The market investigation did not contradict this contention.\nIn any case, for the purposes of this decision the exact market definition can be left open, as regardless of the market definition no competition concerns would arise as a result of the transaction.\u201d\nThe Commission nevertheless left this question open, as it concluded that this would not significantly affect the competitive assessment."

    "text": "The market survey, however, showed the need to distinguish between L gas and H gas for each relevant market. The position is different only with regard to the supply of gas to electricity producers, the volume of L gas consumed by power stations being very limited.\nL gas and H gas require the use of separate delivery infrastructures, both for transmission and for storage, that are not interchangeable.\nThe Commission\u2019s market survey clarified that L gas and H gas do not have the same characteristics or properties and that certain manufacturing processes, in particular in the chemical industry, require the use of H gas. Facilities designed for L gas cannot process H gas, and vice versa, without expensive prior modification of the combustion systems. Moreover, regarding the customers connected to the distribution network, the decision to switch from one type of gas to another is not up to the final customers, because that would suppose that their distribution network manager made the decision to supply the entire network with the new type of gas. Regarding the ability to substitute one gas for another, it has already been said that major investments would be necessary to convert H gas into L gas (and vice versa) and to modify the facilities of final customers. This greatly reduces the substitutability of both supply and demand.\nSimilarly, a CREG study concluded that L gas and H gas are interchangeable to a limited degree only and that competition and access possibilities on the two markets are substantially different.\nUsing the \u2018small but significant non transitory increase in price\u2019 (SSNIP) test, the study confirms that the substitution costs on the demand side would be prohibitive. For industrial customers, the costs consist of installing new pipelines, and for distribution networks, of inspecting and adapting facilities. Regarding substitution costs on the supply side, the study notes the high operating costs of the conversion plants and the absence of sufficient substitutability on the supply side.\nThese considerations clearly argue in favour of distinguishing between L gas and H gas in all supply markets for final customers."

    "topic": "Market for trading on the Zeebrugge hub",
    "text": "A gas-trading hub is a liquidity instrument that provides services to facilitate exchanges between actors on a market. Schematically, a hub facilitates trade between gas buyers and sellers, enabling them to find, in the short term, sufficient volumes of supplies or to sell excess capacity.\nA gas hub can be linked to a physical installation as in Zeebrugge, Belgium. Gas flows are connected to and pass through this point. A hub can also be virtual; one then speaks of a notional point. Such a hub, which has no precise geographical location, makes it possible to trade gas arriving in a given zone. The National Balancing Point (NBP) hub in the United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub in the Netherlands are examples.\nAs acknowledged by the parties in their notification, trading on the Zeebrugge hub constitutes a product market distinct from the other gas markets in Belgium. It operates differently from the supply markets. Supply is used to satisfy the demand of final customers or retailers based on fixed-term contracts and at a location generally chosen by the customer; on the hub, however, there is a more immediate meeting between the supply and demand of the various traders. This results in transactions whereby the gas is normally delivered to the hub. In addition, trading at the hub differs notably from supply to retailers in that generally all the traders act as buyers and sellers. Another characteristic making the Zeebrugge hub unique are the arrangements governing access to the hub, which is currently via the transit network (rTR/vTn). In 2005, all nominations towards the hub were made through the transit network, while less than 4% of the volumes nominated from the hub went through the transmission network, with the remainder going through the transit network."

    "text": "The market for the supply of gas to electricity plants differs from other supply markets in that the competitive conditions are different. Electricity plants consume far more gas than even the large industrial customers do. Moreover, the electricity plants are often directly connected to the transmission network, which distinguishes them from the small industrial and commercial customers and from the residential customers who are connected to the distribution network. Electricity producers can be distinguished from the large industrial customers by their consumption profile: whereas the large industrial customers have a relatively stable demand throughout the year, electricity plants\u2019 demand is subject to greater variation, particularly in function of the season. Consequently, electricity producers have flexibility needs different from those of other final customers. These factors are also reflected in the answers to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire: a majority of respondents consider the market for the supply of gas to electricity producers distinct from the other markets."

    "text": "Large industrial customers differ from other industrial and commercial customers and from household customers, in particular in the volume of their demand, which largely exceeds the volumes required by the other types of customer. Accordingly, large industrial customers generally obtain lower prices and are often connected directly to the transmission network.\nThe parties propose making a distinction between large industrial customers and small industrial and commercial customers based on an annual consumption threshold of 1 million m3 (12 GWh). They maintain that this threshold for distinguishing between the largest gas consumers and other consumers is present in Belgian gas legislation: the Gas Law and the Walloon and Flemish decrees on the organisation of the gas market. These legal instruments are said to have used the threshold of 1 million m3/12 GWh to adjust the timetable for liberalisation of the gas supply market. A significant number of respondents to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire agree with the threshold proposed by the parties.\nThe CREG proposes making a distinction between large industrial customers and other customers based on their connection to the transmission or distribution network. However, the approach proposed by the parties and that of the CREG agree in so far as both approaches regard large industrial customers as a category of customer significantly different from other types of customer. When evaluated according to the CREG\u2019s criteria (connection to the transmission network), the market is smaller than when evaluated according to the criteria proposed by the parties (annual consumption higher than 1 million m3). This also corresponds with certain answers received by the Commission during the market survey, according to which the threshold of 12 GWh proposed by the parties is too low.\nNevertheless, the data provided by the CREG on the basis of its definition of the market largely confirm the data provided by the parties regarding the actors present in the market for large industrial customers and their respective market share. For these reasons, it is not necessary to decide exactly where the threshold is in order to regard a customer as a 'large industrial customer'. For the purposes of this Decision, the competition analysis will be carried out on the basis of the threshold proposed by the parties. The Commission considers that the results of this analysis would be substantially the same using the market definition adopted by the CREG."

    "topic": "Market for the supply of gas to household customers",
    "text": "In its previous decisions, the Commission examined whether there was a separate product market for the supply of gas to household customers but left the question open. Under Belgium\u2019s current regulatory framework, only household customers in Flanders are eligible. Household customers in Wallonia and Brussels are not yet eligible and must currently purchase gas from their local authority utility. This situation will change when the market is completely liberalised on 1 January 2007 in Wallonia and the Brussels Region.\nIn Flanders, the market for household customers was liberalised on 1 July 2003, at the same time as for other customers. It appears, however, that competition in this market has developed differently from in other supply markets, including the market for small industrial and commercial customers. According to the figures provided in the notification, Suez (via ECS) acquired a considerably higher market share of (Flemish) household customers [70-80%]* than small industrial and commercial customers [60-70%]*. This is mainly due to the major role played by the default suppliers (in particular ECS), to which all former customers of the local authority utilities who had not chosen any supplier were transferred once they became eligible. It appears that many more small industrial and commercial customers changed supplier than did household customers.\nEven though the gas supply markets for household customers in Wallonia and Brussels are not yet open to competition, a prospective analysis should take into account the probable effects of the proposed transaction on these markets, for which the date of 1 January 2007 has already been set for liberalisation. In these two regions, the lag between the liberalisation of supply to small industrial and commercial customers (1 July 2004) and to household customers demonstrates that two distinct markets already exist. Moreover, the default suppliers to household customers in these two regions will be determined by the local authority utilities, which could create further differences.\nFor these reasons, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, the market for H gas supply (with the exception of Brussels, where household customers are supplied exclusively with L gas) and the market for L gas supply to household customers are markets distinct from the other gas supply markets."

    "topic": "Zeebrugge hub trading market",
    "text": "In the parties\u2019 view, the Zeebrugge hub in Belgium, the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility in the Netherlands are part of the same market.\nAccording to the parties, these three hubs are already very interconnected since their areas of influence largely overlap. Thus, they say, the Dutch (TTF) and British (NBP) networks are connected to the Belgian transmission and transit network (Zeebrugge). The parties also point out that the NBP and Zeebrugge hubs are directly connected to each other, since they are located at either extremity of the Interconnector (connecting Zeebrugge and Bacton, UK), the capacity of which is being increased.\nIn addition, the three hubs will be even more closely inter-linked when the BBL gas pipeline between the Netherlands (Balgzand) and the United Kingdom (Bacton), scheduled for late 2006, opens.\nThe parties would also highlight the convergence of prices seen between these hubs. Any fluctuations in prices, according to them, have been within a narrow band. Cases where prices at the hubs have diverged significantly could be resolved rapidly, notably by major infrastructure investments.\nFinally, the parties point out that the gas exchanges at these three hubs are all operated by APX Gas. APX, an independent Dutch company, created a subsidiary, APX Gas, which since 2004 has been electronically managing gas transactions at the NBP, TTF and Zeebrugge hubs (through APX Gas Zeebrugge B.V., in which APX and Fluxys subsidiary Huberator are shareholders). APX Gas can monitor transactions on the three hubs, using a single application and on a single screen.\nIn its statement of objections, however, the Commission expressed doubts concerning the parties' hypothesis of a single market comprised of the three hubs. The mitigated results of the market survey indicated that, although prices at these three hubs partially correlated with each other and often fluctuated in the same direction, significant price differences between the hubs persisted, in particular during the winter of 2005-06. Moreover, in its statement of objections the Commission pinpointed insufficient transmission and transit capacity and the resulting constraints as the principal obstacle to establishing a 'geographical link' between the three hubs.\nRegarding the NBP and Zeebrugge hubs in particular, the statement of objections referred to a detailed analysis prepared by British regulator Ofgem. Ofgem had analysed prices, including transmission costs, during the period January 2000 to April 2006. The analysis showed that, on 17% of the days during this period, the difference in prices between the NBP and Zeebrugge was greater than 7.5% i.e., the approximate costs of using the Interconnector.\nIn their reply to the statement of objections, the parties cited notably the 'obvious' convergence of prices between the Zeebrugge and NBP hubs since 2004. The parties attribute the price differences observed by Ofgem to start-up problems at the Zeebrugge hub. According to the parties, 'this situation [of differences during the Zeebrugge hub\u2019s initial phase] is over, because a net increase in liquidity at the hub has been noted in later years, as has a better interconnection between the two hubs following the extension of the Interconnector'.\nThereafter, the Commission again consulted Ofgem and asked it to carry out the same analysis for the last 24 months, i.e., the period July 2004 - June 2006. That analysis showed that the difference between the price at the NBP and the price at the Zeebrugge hub was greater than 7.5% on 8% of the days during this period. There is thus increasing convergence between the prices at the two hubs, in particular in comparison with the four previous years. However, Ofgem also reproduced an analysis of price differences at the three hubs: NBP, Zeebrugge and TTF. Ofgem observed that prices at the three hubs diverged significantly during certain periods, in particular during the winter of 2005-06. Ofgem\u2019s data show that the differences between the TTF and the two other hubs are much more pronounced than the differences between the NBP and the Zeebrugge hub.\nBased on the parties\u2019 reply and its own complementary investigations, the Commission agrees that prices at the NBP and Zeebrugge are increasingly converging. This convergence will likely continue, given the plans to increase the Interconnector\u2019s capacity. According to Ofgem, the extension of the interconnection between Belgium and Great Britain should, if the markets function in a competitive manner, result in increased convergence of the markets and less divergence, because constraints on transmission will be reduced.\nOfgem rightly states that differences in prices may be due to causes other than limits on capacity, in particular the various balancing arrangements. The Commission\u2019s complementary investigation revealed that the Belgian balancing regime, despite displaying certain elements of hourly balancing, comes very close to the daily balancing used in the United Kingdom.\nIn the statement of objections, the Commission identified another probable cause for the price divergences between the NBP and the Zeebrugge hub, namely the control exercised by Distrigaz & Co. over the infrastructures linking the Zeebrugge hub with the Belgian network and with other pipelines and the resulting access difficulties for other operators. This obstacle will be eliminated, however, by the remedies proposed by the parties. The commitments proposed by the parties with a view to increasing the hub's liquidity and thereby reducing the barriers to entry to the Belgian gas markets provide for the transfer of the marketing rights for the transit network (which connects to the hub) to Fluxys and submission to the Code of Conduct.\nIn the light of the above, the Commission concludes that competitive conditions on the Zeebrugge and NBP hubs have considerably converged and it expects this convergence to continue owing to the commitments facilitating access to the hub. For the purposes of this Decision, these two hubs can therefore be regarded as belonging to the same market. However, the Commission concludes that the TTF does not form part of this same market in view of the price differences which, compared with the Zeebrugge hub and the NBP, are more frequent and more significant than between these two hubs."

However, regarding the market for the supply of gas to household customers, the Commission discussed the possibility of a regional dimension (Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels Region) while leaving the question open. It cited differences in regulatory conditions, which were not homogeneous across the regions, in particular as regards the opening of household customer gas supply to competition.\nThe Commission\u2019s market survey provided some indication that the household customer market should be considered regional. Firstly, each of the three regions has different regulations regarding the supply of gas to household customers. These differences also include different dates for opening the market to competition. Moreover, the three regions attach varying importance to L gas for supply to household customers. For example, household customers in the Brussels Region are supplied almost exclusively with L gas, while the remainder of the country is supplied with H or L gas according to the location of the final user.\nSecondly, opening up the household customer markets in Wallonia and the Brussels Region will probably lead to a gradual alignment of competitive conditions in the three regions, as was the case with the other customer categories. That would demonstrate that these markets had a national dimension. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this Decision it is not necessary to decide whether the household customer markets are national or regional, because the notified merger would impede effective competition significantly whatever market definition is used.\nIn conclusion, the relevant gas markets in Belgium affected by the notified transaction are: \n\u2022 Market for the supply of gas to electricity producers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to dealers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to large industrial customers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to small industrial customers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to household customers (national or regional).\nIf these markets were to be considered regional, the relevant product market would include only L gas in the Brussels Region."

In their reply to the decision under Article 6(1)(c) the parties contest the existence of a wholesale market other than the market for gas supply to retailers. However, the parties acknowledge the importance of the question of access to gas resources for operators active in markets further down the line. In fact, regardless of whether a wholesale market is defined in the strict sense of the term or the matter is considered from the point of view of access to gas, the notified merger would undeniably lead to an overlap between the parties\u2019 activities at wholesale level or at the level of access to gas."

The Commission also investigated whether a distinction based on the form of glass coatings i.e. dry glass coatings a nd liquid glass coatings, could be warranted and, finally, whether it would be appropriate to single out the manufacture and supply of forehearth colourants. The results of the market investigation and corresponding Commission\u2019s assessment are set out bel ow.\nOn the demand -side, a majority of competitors and customers alike indicated that customers would not be able to use the various types of glass coatings interchangeably . A majority of customers indicated , accordingly , that they would not be able to switch from one type of glass coating to another , because notably of the differences existing between the application process es (as each type of coating is applied to a specific type of glass, requiring different types of machinery) , the characteristics of the products (formulation of the glass coating itself require different types of additives depending on the end -application ), as well as their specific products requirements (resistance to scratching, heat etc. required b y customers varying significantly between each type of end -application) . A customer explains for example that the flat glass coating industry is typically simpler in terms of application abilities requirements (e.g. spray, roll, coated on) than the automo tive industry which is more sophisticated in terms of the techniques used.\nOn the supply -side, competitors pointed out certain similarities in the raw materials used and the production process of each end -applications, despite stressing differenc es in product features and know how. Customers also consistently noted that the production processes and the underlying technology largely varie s depending on the end -use application. Furthermore, the results of the market investigation were mixed in rel ation to the c ompetitors \u2019 ability to switch production between the various types of glass coatings in a relatively short timeframe and without incurring significant costs . While some competitors indicated that they would be in a position to switch producti on and would do so in case of a change in market conditions, others indicated that they would not have this ability.\nIn this respect, the Commission notes that the market investigation highlighted that the Parties\u2019 competitors do not focus the core of th eir activities on all three types of end-use application consistently, but they rather specialise in one or two areas and they tend to have limited activities in the other ones. A competitor also indicated that prices differ also from one type of end -use application to another. For example, coatings for automotive glass tend to be more expensive than non -automotive coatings, although in some instances, for example for some niche applications involving precious metals, non -automotive glass coatings may also be expensive.\nIn light of the above, the Commission leaves open the question as to whether it is necessary, to distinguish, within the manufacture and supply of glass coatings, some separate markets according to the end -use application i.e. automotive glass coatings, flat glass coatings, and container glass coatings."

Dry glass coatings are mixed with a liquid medium used as an input for the preparation of liquid glass coatings. As such, customers of dry coatings are either distributors or end customers which mix dry glass coatings at their own premises, for resale or own purposes use.\nAccordingly, dry glass coatings constitute only a marginal part of the supply of glass coatings overall. In addition , on the basis of the data provided by the Parties, the Parties and virtually all competitors supply liquid glass coatings for the main end -applications, i.e. automotive, flat glass and container glass.\nThese observations were confirmed in the course of the market investigation. A minority of competitors indicated that they supplied glass coatings in dry form in the EEA and, even when they did, such competitors indicated that dry coatings only accounted for a minimal proportion of their supply.\nAs to distributors exercising an intermediary role \u2013 consisting in sourcing dry glass coatings from manufacturers and transforming it into liquid glass coatings to resell to customers \u2013 the results of the market invest igation results suggest that their activity is negligible. Only half of competitors and a minority of customers are aware of the presence of such distributors on the market, and these players are considered to only be able to supply very limited volumes.\nIn light of these elements, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to distinguish glass coatings according to their form, and that dry and liquid glass coatings should be considered altogether within each and every relevant markets ."

The second method is the in -glass method, which changes the colour of the entire glass material and not only the surface of the glass container. The i n-glass colouring can be achieved using both traditional glass coatings and forehearth colourants. As a result, traditional glass coatings and forehearth colourants differ in their application process but deman d for glass coatings applied on the surface of a container and forehearth products used in -glass typically come from the same customer groups and competitors are in a position to switch between forehearth coatings and other glass coatings in response to a change in price of either product.\nIn light of these elements, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to distinguish forehearth colourants from container glass coatings."

Additionally, customers highlighted the existence of price differences between the EEA and other regions of the world and indicated transport costs and geographical proximity to their suppliers\u2019 manufacturing plant as elements playing a role in their choice of a supplier of porcelain enamel coatings . In terms of transport costs, the majority of customers observed that, while transport costs represent 0 -5% of the tot al price of the product when the supplier is EEA -based, they represent 5 -10% of the total price of the product when the supplier is based outside of the EEA and supplies EEA -based customers. In terms of geographic location, certain customers claim that it is essential that technical experts working for porcelain enamel coatings\u2019 supplier s be in close contact with their customers , as they might be asked to intervene at their customers\u2019 production sites at short notice, should a technical issue occur. The va st majority of customers indicated that they source the largest part of their porcelain enamel coatings needs at EEA -wide level and, to a more limited extent, they source their needs from Turkish suppliers , which are considered by the majority of customers as credible as EEA -based suppliers .\nIn light of the elements set out above, the Commission deem s it appropriate to define the geographic scope of the market for porcelain enamel as EEA-wide and, potent ially, including Turkey. The Commission , however, considers that the question relating to the precise scope of the geographic market for porcelain enamel coatings can be left open since the competitive assessment would not materially differ under any plausible market definition.\nFor the purpose of the present case, the Commission will carry out its competitive assessment on the overall market for the manufacture and supply of porcelain enamel coatings at EEA -wide level and in the alternative regional market including the EEA and Turkey ."

When determining whether to purchase the Target, CVC assessed growth tr ends, profitability and solvency specifically for Ethniki\u2019s health insurance business, separate from life insurance and other types of non-life insurance services. Third -party reports on insurance services in Greece refer to market trends in health insur ance services separately from other types of non-life insurance. In the market investigation, one of Ethniki\u2019s rivals indicate s: \u201cprivate health insurance in Greece was traditionally offered as an \u201cadd -on\u201d to life insurance. However, this practice is gradually being abandoned in the market and health insurance policies are offered on a standalone basis \u201d.\n(22) The Commission\u2019s investigation also show s that the market for health insurance services should not include insurance products that offer cash payme nts in case of accidents or critical illness.\n(23) In particular, the vast majority of health insurer respondents in Greece confirm that from a demand -side perspective health insurance products are not substitutable with policies offering cash payments for ac cidents or critical illness. For example, one of Ethniki\u2019s rivals notes that accident insurance policies \u201care based on a different philosophy [than health insurance policies, they] are intended to meet other needs and generally, [they] are simpler and mor e economical in terms of premiums \u201d. Another health insurer respondent states that critical illness insurance products \u201ccover only specific serious (dread) diseases and pay a lump sum upon their occurence. They do not cover any treatment expenses and also they don\u2019t cover the majority of diseases \u201d. In addition, s everal health insurer respondents indicated that customers purchase insurance policies offering cash payments for accidents or critical illness as a complement to health insurance products.\n(24) From a supply -side perspective, the market investigation also confirm s that health insurance services are not substitutable with accident and critical illness insurance policies . For health insurance services, insurers often negotiate with healthc are providers regarding the fees of the various medical servic es and in case of treatment, the insurer pays directly the contracted healthcare provider. By contrast, for accident and critical illness insurance policies, insurers make a lump sum payment directl y to the policyholder."

In the market investigation, the vast majority of private hospital respondents confirm that public hospital services and private hospital services in Greece are not interchangeable based on prices; quality of med ical operations; patient comfort; or availability of beds. Greek patients also seem to agree with this conclusion.

As o ne of HHG\u2019s rivals puts it, the two types of hospitals differ because \u201c the legislative requirements... the patients\u2019 needs... the doctors\u2019 needs... [and] the overall business models differ \u201d. Another private hospital operator explains: \u201c[m]aternity [c]linics are narrowly focused on the birt hs and associated female medicine. Most maternity clinics are managed by gyna ecologists and were set up by them as partnerships. The revenue is produced by the doctor there who easily decides to move to another maternity clinic. Private [g]eneral [h]ospitals are for all other cases and in most cases the patient comes through the hospital's reputation or because of their insurers agreement with the hospital\u201d.\nb) In the market investigation, t he vast majority of private hospital respondents also submit th at it is appropriate to distinguish between general private hospital services and diagnostic centre services in Greece. One of HHG\u2019s competitors notes: \u201c[d] iagnostic centres offer a different range of healthcare services than general clinics, targeting m ostly outpatients (i.e. patients that will not stay in the hospital for inpatient treatment). Such centers offer a range of examinations such as blood tests, MRI scans, CT scans, as well as limited doctor specialties (pathologist, general surgeon, cardiolo gist)... Additionally, a diagnostic services network usually offers much more (and smaller) points of sale compared to a hospital group, as part of its business strategy... \u201d.\nc) A third -party report also discusses market trends in private hospital services i n Greece separately for (i) general private hospitals; (ii) maternity private hospitals; and (iii) diagnostic centres."

In the market investigation, a ll but one of the private hospital respondents submit that they offer both in patient and outpatient services in their hospitals. Moreover, the vast majority of private hospitals in Attica today offer several and comparable medical specialisations. I n the market investigation, the majority of private hospital respondents submit t hat they expanded the specialisations offered in their hospitals in the past 3 years. Most of the private hospital respondents estimate that they managed this expansion within 1-2 years.\nb) From a demand -side substitutability perspective, the Commission n otes that the treatment of certain ailments may require involvement of doctors and equipment across specialities (e.g., treatment by a gastroenterologist following surgery in the hospital's general surgery department).\nc) As regards demand specifically from insurance companies, the Commission notes that many of them need to cooperate with private hospitals both on inpatient and outpatient services. For example, the top three health insurance players in Greece (NN, Ethniki, and Generali) offer insurance p olicies which cover both inpatient and outpatient services."

    "topic": "General Private Hospital Services in Attica",
    "text": "The Commission\u2019s investigation show s that th ere is a separate relevant market for general private hospital services which is limited to Attica. This is the case for the following reasons.\n(43) First , the vast majority of private hospital providers submit that i n case of service quality decrease in a private hospital in Attica, patients would only consider alternatives in Attica. One of the competitors of HHG states : \u201cthe geographic market for priva te healthcare services [is] Attica-wide and not national [\u2026] the catchment area of private hospitals in Athens is the wider Attica region .\u201d Another rival adds: \u201c it is highly unlikely [for] citizens \u2013 patient s to travel outside Attica for hospital care. Traditionally the best quality of care in terms of... private facilities and doctors are located in [the] Attica region \u201d.\n(44) Second , health insurance providers who often cover claims for general private hospital services also indicate that private hospitals do not compete across regions of Greece and that private hospitals in Attica compete with each other. One of Ethniki\u2019s competitors submits: \u201c customers based in Athens and Thessaloniki seek treatment in Athens and Thessaloniki respectively. [Our] customers who live in other parts of Greece without good public hospitals in close proximity may source healthcare services in Athens or Thessaloniki \u201d. Another rival of Ethniki adds : \u201c[p]olicyholders who reside in Athens or Thessaloniki will seek healthcare in Athens or Thessaloniki, respectively. Exceptionally, policy holders who reside in areas close to Athens... or in the islands will come to Athens for healthcare services .\u201d\n(46) Four th, the Notifying Party submits that [90-100]% of Ethniki \u2019s insured patients residing in the Attica region select a private hospital in the Attica region. [60-70]% of Ethniki \u2019s insured patients residing outside the Attica region also select a private hospital in the Attica region. The Notifying Party considers that this supports the existence of a \u201c national (albeit Attica -centric) market for private general hospitals \u201d. However, the fact that many patients travel to Attica from other regions of Greece to seek treatment does not mean that the relevant geographic market should be defined at national level. Instead, this fact confirms that private hospitals in Attica ha ve \u201c... the highest level of care in Greece, have the most capacity, the shortest distance for the largest population in Greece, and the largest doctor selection \u201d. For these reasons, private hospitals in Attica do not compete with private hospitals in ot her regions of the country.\n(47) Fifth, contrary to the Notifying Party\u2019s claims, most of the private hospital respondents in the Commission\u2019s market investigation indicate that they are active only in one region (and typically, in Attica). But even considering the few competitors who operate hospitals in more than one regions, their activities do not support a national geographic market definition for general private hospital services. For example, HHG operates five hospitals in Attica an d one in Crete (Creta Interclinic). In its internal strategy document for FY2021, HHG indicates that Creta Interclinic should focus on demand of tourists and local population in Crete and thus, it would not compete with hospitals in Attica. Another exam ple of a private hospital service provider which operates hospitals in and outside Attica is Athens Medical Group (\u201cAMG \u201d). AMG operates five hospitals in Attica and one in Thessaloniki (Interbalkan Medical Centre). During the Commission\u2019s market investiga tion, AMG submitted: \u201c private hospitals outside Attica do not exert any competitive pressure on private hospitals in the Attica region ... the catchment area of Attica -based hospitals still does not span beyond the Attica region ...\u201d."

As such, mobile harbour cranes are appreciated by customers, often in smaller ports, which deal with various cargo types but are less common in larger ports specialising in the handling of shipping containers where other crane types are more suitable. This has been evidenced in the market investigation where the majority of customers have indicated that , if they needed to replace one of their existing mobile harbour cranes, they would most likely replace it with another mobile harbour crane rather than another type of crane.

In that respect, the Notifying Party itself submits that in-flight equipment services are generally not tendered by airlines together with in-flight catering services \u201c but generally tendered separately and independent of in-flight catering services contracts \u201d. The airlines tend to purchase in-flight equipment services centrally and then make the in-flight equipment products available to the in-flight caterer that \u201cwill be in charge of handling the equipment\u201d and bring it on-board. The Notifying Party\u2019s submission was confirmed by the majority of customers during the market investigation. The majority of airline customers purchase the in-flight equipment services themselves and subsequently make the equipment products available to their in-flight caterer. The majority of airline-customers that purchase other services than in-flight catering (such as in-flight equipment services) do not typically purchase in-flight catering services and other services together from one single supplier. Often, even different components of equipment services are tendered individually. The majority of customers also indicated that they have no problem with purchasing in-flight catering services separately from other services such as in-flight equipment services, citing flexibility, greater choice, better prices as well as quality of products offered as the main reason for sourcing these other services separately from in-flight catering.\nSecond, contrary to the Notifying Party\u2019s claim, the majority of in-flight caterers do not provide in-flight equipment services as ancillary services to their core business, or only to a very limited extent. None of the Parties\u2019 in-flight catering services competitors are among their main competitors with regards to the provision of in-flight equipment services.\nIn view of the above considerations, for the purpose of this decision, the Commission considers that equipment services are not ancillary to in-flight catering services and constitute a relevant separate market. The question whether equipment services should be segmented by type of customers can be left open, as the Transaction is unlikely to raise competition concerns with respect to the market for equipment services, even on a plausible narrower market for in-flight equipment services."

Regarding the segmentations according to (i) the type of packaging (between carton and aseptic PET) and (ii) the production process (between aseptic and non -aseptic, as well as between ambient and chilled), the results of the market investigation confirms previous findings that they are separate product markets. Indeed, the majority of the upstream competitors who expressed an opinion on these points consider that is difficult in terms of costs and time involved to change between types of packaging and between ambient and chilled production processes. Regarding the potential segmentation between the production and bottling of organic and non- organic NABs, the majority of upstream competitors that responded in the market investigation at this point consider that is reasonably easy to switch the production from organic juice to non- organic juice and vice versa. The majority of market participants indicated that the main difference between the production and bottling of organic and non- organic NABs relates is the certifications needed for the raw material to be classified as of organic origin. In relation to private label and contract manufacturing of NABs, a large majority of upstream competitors indicated that suppliers active exclusively in the production and bottling of private label NABs to retailers are able to start contract manufacturing for brand owners swiftly and without significant costs. The opposite is also true according to the upstream competitors: suppliers active exclusively in the contract manufacturing of NABs are able to start contract manufacturing private labels for brand owners swiftly and without significant costs. In any event, for the purpose of the present case, in line with the Commission\u2019s precedents and considering the Target is only active in the sale of branded fruit juices, the assessment will be done at the narrower plausible level, i.e. considering branded contract manufacturing as a separate market from the production and bottling of private label NABs."

    "text": "The Commission considers that, consistently with its past practice, plausible relevant product markets exist separately for juice and that within the sale of juice a separate market may exist for orange juice, possibly with a further segmentation between FC and NFC orange juice. Within the juices market, the results of the market investigation indicate that orange juices are not substitutable with other fruit juices in terms of demand, prices and brands. As some downstream competitors stated: \u201c[o]range Juice SKUs see consistently far higher (2- 3x) rate of sale than any other SKU, even when merchandised, placed and priced similarly to other flavours. Very simply, replacing an OJ SKU with any other blend will lead to much lower sales \u201d or \u201c [t]here is very little customer substitution in this category. Most customers buy orange juice for a specific need and would rarely substitute it for another fruit juice \u201d. Regarding the segmentation between organic and non- organic, even though the majority of downstream competitors indicate that the share of organic juices sold is low, also the majority of downstream competitors consider that organic and non -organic juices are not substitutable: \u201cthe organic mention is probably a key point in the purchasing decision, making it difficult to substitute for a non- organic purchase \u201d, and \u201c[t]he supply and demand for organic juices differs a lot from conventional juices. Currently resulting in a much higher price for raw materials \u201d."

In that decision, the Commission also considered that there was no need to draw a distinction between linear TV channels and their non-linear ancillary services.\nIn its previous decisions, the Commission also examined a number of other potential segmentations of the market for the wholesale supply of TV channels but ultimately left the market definition open, as regards: (i) genre or thematic content (films, sports, news, children/ youth, and others); and (ii) different means of infrastructure used for the delivery to the consumer (cable, satellite, terrestrial TV and IPTV).

    "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission considered whether to distinguish between residential and non -residential customers in the market for the retail supply of fixed telephony services. While the Commission left the precise scope of the market for the retail supply of fixed telephony services open in several decisions, it found in recent decisions that such a market does not contain further segmentations and that the overall product ma rket for fixed telephony services includes fixed telephony services provided over the Internet Protocol (Voice -over-IP or \u201cVoIP \u201d services ).\nThe majority of the competitors respond ing to the market investigation agreed that the market for fixed telephony services encompasses the retail provision of fixed telephony services both through fixed telephony lines and through VoIP services. The market investigation did not provide a clear indication as to whether a distinction between local/national and international calls is appropriate. The Commission observes tha t the use of fixed telephony (in minutes), both for domestic and international calls has been consistently decreasing over the years, with the volume (in minutes) of international calls being less than 2% of the total usage. In parallel, all market players sell multiple -play bundle for a comprehensive fee including their individual services. The Commission therefore does not consider that a separate market exists for local and international calls. \nThe results of the market investigation are mixed when it comes to a potential distinction of the market between residential and non -residential customers. The explanations provided by about half of the respondents point to a distinction existing between the two categories. In fact , it has been explained , non-residential customers, in particular medium and large enterprises , have different requirements from residential customers , in terms of products and quality of services, and for this reason are supported from different departments/personnel of telecommunicatio ns service providers. It has also been observed that service s and prices applicable to the two categories differ and that , both on the demand and on the supply side , residential and non -residential customers can not be co nsidered as part of the same market One respondent, on the other hand , points also to similarities between the two categories, both in terms of demand and supply characteristics. At the same time, t he same respondent explains that, notwithstanding such similarities, residential customers ar e more likely to buy fixed services as part of multiple -play bundles. The Commission considers that such preference for multiple -play offers excludes supply side substitutability between the two services, as suppliers of services to business customers are not necessarily able to provide multiple -play offers to residential customers, with a nation -wide reach, like suppliers of residential customers are typically able to do. \nIn light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this Decision, the relevant product market is the market for the retail supply of fixed telephony services including VoIP services. With respect to a possible distinction between residential and non -residential (business) customers , the Commission considers that t he market definition can be left open, as this distinction does not affect the outcome of the assessment . The Parties, in fact, have limited activities in the segment including large business customers and the Transaction does not lead to an affected marke t in that respect."

    "text": "In recent cases, the Co mmission has considered that the relevant product market consists of the overall retail market for the provision of fixed internet access services, including all product types (narrowband, broadband, dedicated access), distribution modes (DSL, cable, fibre , fixed -wireless -access (\u201cFWA\u201d)) and speeds/bandwidths, to residential and small business customers, excluding the supply of fixed internet services provided through mobile network infrastructure (i.e. \u201cfLTE\u201d).\nAs for large business customers, the Commis sion indicated that they belong to a separate market for the retail supply of business connectivity services.\nAs regards fLTE services in particular, in its past practice (including recent decisions ), the Commission did not identify these services as bein g part of a standalone market. It rather considered that fLTE services should be included in the overall market for retail mobile telecommunications services.\nIn line with the Notifying Party\u2019s submission and the results of the market investigation, the Commission considers that it would be appropriate to co nsider an overall retail market for the supply of fixed internet access services, including all product types, distribution modes and speeds/bandwidths, to residential and SOHO customers, but excluding fLTE.\nIn fact, w ith regard to fixed internet access se rvices provided through mobile network infrastructure, the respondents to the market investigation confirmed that fixed broadband internet access services are not substitutable with mobile broadband access services, because of differences, primarily in pri cing models , but also because of the ir different uses. Internet access via mobile networks is designed with mobility as a key feature, which greatly affects bandwidth and data transmission , as compared to fixed internet access services . Further, mobile access does not have the same levels of reliability and stability, as the speed of the networks depends on the network that covers the area where the end user is located. As to supply -side substitutability between fixed internet access and fLTE, a respond ent to the market investigation explains that mobile operators in Greece are in the process of deploying 5G. It is possible that, o ver time, these next -generation mobile services will bring significant improvements to the broadband services offered via mob ile connections including high -speed access and very hi gh network capacity. As such , 5G services have the potential, depending on location, to pose a greater competitive constraint on fixed broadband. However, limitations will remain and the expansion of 5G will be gradual and will not ensure, at least for the time being, homogeneity in supply.\nWith respect to a possible distinction by customer type, most respondents to the market investigation took the view that fixed internet access services provided to residential and SOHO customers , on the one hand, and large business and government customers , on the other hand , belong to separate markets. This is because, according to the respondents , the interchangeability between the two services is not perfect. Also, the requirements and purchase processes of larger business customers for fixed or fixed -mobile services are usually materially different (e.g. they may use tender or other competitive procedures) . The Commission further notes that, also from a supply side perspective, there is no perfect substitution between the services provided to the two categories. In fact, a provider supplying services to residential and SOHO customers could (at least in theory) switch to supplying large business customers. The r everse, however, could be more difficult, as supplying residential customers would require an extended network with a vast footprint, which not all suppliers of large business and government customers might have.\nThe Commission, therefore, concludes that services provided to residential customers and SOHO customers, on the one hand, and to large business and government customers belong to separate product markets.\nIn light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this Decision, the relevant product market is the market for the retail supply of fixed internet access services, including all product types, distribution modes, and speeds/bandwidth, to residential and SOHO customers, excluding fixed internet access services provided t hrough mobile network infrastructure."

In particular, OTE, the leading pay -TV provider in Greece, indicates that the increasing offering of streaming on -demand content by FTA channels in Greece (ERTflix etc.) as well as the offering of p remium sports and film content by FTA channels allows FTA channels to exert competitive pressure on pay-TV channels. In addition, another competitor adds, customers appear to use an array of choices for the consumption of video content (including pay -TV, OTT, transaction -video -on-demand (\u201c TVOD \u201d), video sharing, free video, advertising -supported video, etc.) . The same competitor indicated that while some customers may watch pay TV channels as an alternative or substitute to FTA TV channels, customers may rely on these channels or, for example, subscription video -on-demand (\u201c SVOD \u201d) services as complementary"

The Dragon Professional product can be used in a number of sectors . The \u201cbase\u201d of products offered by Nuance outside of healthcare would essentially be the same. Depending on the customer\u2019s needs and preferences, Nuance works with the individual customer to customise the software and map commands that match specific workflows (including specific linguistic requirements) , rather than implementing significant differences in its products between sectors outside healthcare . Nuance\u2019s focus on certain sectors is a commercial decision having identified sectors with use cases for its products.\n\nThe Notifying Party considers that the relevant market for transcription software outside healthcare includes both transcription and voice control accessibility solutions. While the transcription and accessibility functionalities differ, the same speech recognition technology that powers transcription can be used to power accessibility. The two functionalities are also offered together as part of the same Dragon software.\n\nIn addition, the Notifying Party argues that the lines between the two functionalities are blurred. What can be defined as accessibility functionality also includes transcription functionality. A user can command the OS to open a certain application (i.e., an accessibility function) and then continue to use the application with their voice, transcribing the voice input into text (i.e., the transcription function), relying on the same Dragon software. For instance, they could direct the OS to open their email application and then dictate the content of the email."

The majority of customers for transcription software replied that these products are valid alternatives, although some respondents indicate that this is true for certain use cases only . The superiority of one solution over another will depend on customer-specific factors, such as resource and timing constraints, design goals, and issues specific to the customer\u2019s industry. An out-of-the-box solution enables customers (such as hospitals) to use the feature immediately, with the software provider managing the quality, robustness, and enhancement of the feature. The API/ SDK approach , on the other hand, enables customers to customise and modify their use of this feature in a manner that best suits their needs.

To implement such functionality, the software needs to be able to distinguish and recognise different speakers.

Concretely, the market investigation showed that post -separation and LWP sorting in fact take place at different levels of the waste management value chain, with post -separation being a necessary intermediary step before LWP sorting when no source -separation is being carried out.35 Moreover, the Parties admit that post -separations services are subject to different contracts than LWP sorting .36 Respondents to the market investigation ha ve confirmed that operators of post -separation facilities do not com pete for LWP sorting contracts and, vice -versa, LWP sorters do not compete for post -separation contracts .37 As a result,  post-separation services do not compete with LWP services.

Member States however have discretion regarding the manner in which they choose to implement this obli gation, and schemes implementing the Packaging Directive vary by country in their design and scope. Under the Dutch \u2018extended producer responsibility\u2019 regime , which implements the Packaging Directive,60 producers and importers of packaged products are legal ly responsible for the prevention, collection and recycling of packaging waste. Such companies, when they are above a certain size, must register with Afvalfonds Verpakkingen (\u2018 Afvalfonds \u2019),61 and pay a fee to Afvalfonds according to the volumes of packaging they place on the market. In exchange, Afvalfonds takes over their responsibility for the recycling of packaging waste. Nedvang BV (\u2018 Nedvang \u2019, formerly \u2018VPKT \u2019) is the fully-owned subsidiary of Afvalfonds that ensures the practical implementation of the extended producer responsibility principle, both directly by contracting for the sorting and recycling of packaging waste, and indirectly by compensating other bodies that arrange for sorting and recycling.   Moreover, the composition of LWP to be sorted and the manner in which collection of waste is organised varies from country to country. For instance, Dutch LWP typically has a higher plastic content that LWP originating in Germany, where plastic bottles are partly covered by a deposit scheme and recovered separately.62 These differences have a decisive impact in the sorting process , as explained in Section 4.2.2.2(D).  In short, demand for LWP sorting services is structured nationally, based on national rules governing the legal responsibility for the collection and sorting of LWP . As such, in the following section,  the Commission will assess the competitive conditions for the supply of LWP sorting services to customers  in the Netherlands, where the Parties\u2019 activities overlap."

    "text": "The supply of LWP sorting services  to Dutch customers  appears to be limited by a number of factors, in particular distance from the plant to collection point, customer preferences, composition of LWP and national regulations, although t his does not prevent some facilities located  in Germany from  also sort ing LWP  from the Netherlands . Concretely, of the approximately 450kt of Dutch LWP sorted in 2020, around 1/3rd was sorted in plants in Germany located close to the Dutch border (with the farthest plant being situated 150km from the border in driving distance).  In order to identify the area in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous , the Commission will assess the barriers that exist for the sorting of LWP  from the Netherlands , as identified by the market investigation. The following factors are relevant for this assessment: first, transport costs significantly limit the distance which LWP can travel to reach an LWP sorting plant. Second, environmental costs are taken into account as  customers try to avoid transporting LWP for sorting over long distances to minimize the associated CO 2 emissions. Third, beyond transport and environmental costs, LWP sorters broadly report that customers have a preference for keeping  waste within the country. Fourth, due to the specific LWP composition and quality requirements, technical adjustments are required for a German (or Belgian) plant to be able to sort also Dutch LWP. Fifth , sending LWP for sorting outside the  Netherlands involves more administrative formalities than sorting the LWP with in the country."

A majority of laboratory and CRO service providers that replied to the Commission\u2019s market investigation indicated to consider them separate markets. Respondents pointed out that the customers for th e two services are different, as for laboratory services for clinical development the customers are pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, or CRO service providers, while for laboratory services for diagnostic purposes the customers are physici ans or hospitals. The required footprint is different as well \u2013 laboratory service providers for clinical development typically have few laboratories globally (PPD has eight), while for diagnostic purposes a more regional presence is required. Respondents also pointed out that d ifferent accreditations and standards apply , and that instruments are more easily substitutable in diagnostics laboratories as there is not the same criticality associated with consistency of testing results and patient data. Therefore, while they may employ some of the same testing methods, the Commission considers that laboratory services for diagnostic purposes and laboratory services for clinical development (i.e. laboratory services in the context of clinical trials and complian ce with pharmaceutical GMP ) constitute separate product markets."

In PKN Orlen / Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered that on- motorway fuel stations (including those located on toll and non -toll motorways and expressways) likely constituted a distinct market segment in Poland, but as the evidence was not clear -cut, the Commission left the exact market definition open.

    "text": "Regarding a possible segmentation between the retail supply of motor fuels to B2B customers and to B2C customers, the Commission defined sales with the use of fuel cards as B2B sales and sales without the use of fuel cards as B2C sales, since sales to B2B customers without the use of fuel cards are undistinguishable from sales to B2C customers. Fuel cards are issued by fuel station operators, such as the Parties, and (international) fuel card providers such as DKV and UTA, who act as intermediaries between fuel station operators and fuel card holders (B2B customers). In PKN Orlen / Grupa Lotos , the Commission concluded that a segmentation between sales to B2B customers and to B2C customers (based on the use of a fuel card, where fuel cards are merely tools used to provide a differentiated offer to B2B customers ) was appropriate because of the different price setting/levels (with B2C customers always paying the local pump price, whereas B2B customers receive discounts on the local pump price or they negotiate a rebate on a spot price set at national level), and the diverse needs of both groups of customers. In particular, B2B customers have different requirements relating to the network coverage of their motor fuel suppliers, including putting more importance than B2C customers on a network having a significant number of on -motorways stations. In addition, the features of fuel cards can include additional services such as toll payments, or online tools for managing company fuel use as well as payment conditions , and B2C customers do not normally have access to fuel cards."

    "text": "The Notifying Party considers that it is not warranted to segment the game publishing market based on genre or type of games. As regards game genres, the Notifying Party considers that genre classification is subjective and gamers play different genres on the basis of their personal preferences. From a supply-side perspective, a studio can create games of different genres, or involving elements of multiple genres. As regards game types, the Notifying Party submits that there is some evidence of a low degree of demand-side substitution between AAA games and non-AAA games. This is because AAA games offer more complex gameplay features and mechanics, as well as a longer play time. Moreover, there may be also low supply-side substitution from non-AAA games to AAA games, based on the budget and technological innovation that the development of AAA games requires. This would make it burdensome for small studios to switch from non-AAA to AAA games. However, the Notifying Party also puts forward that boundaries between AAA and non-AAA games are blurred and subjective. Gamers may play various game types according to their preferences and regardless of the status of the game. Furthermore, certain games initially developed as non-AAA games have become successful and highly regarded over time, involving an increasingly higher budget and larger development teams. At the same time, some games developed on an AAA budget were not considered as such by gamers. In addition, the Notifying Party considers that a segmentation of the market according to other possible game types (stand-alone games, browser games, free-to-play and freemium games), as well as by type of gamer (e.g., hardcore vs casual gamer) is not warranted. In any event, the Notifying Party submits that the exact product market definition can be left open for the purpose of assessing this Transaction."

Moreover, the majority of respondents submitted that games generally compete across genres, but that competition is stronger between games of the same game genre.

However, in the Daimler/BMW/Car Sharing JV  decision, in light of the supply -side substitutability in that specific case, the Commission conducted its assessment on the basis of an overall leasing market combining operational and financial leasing. \nWhile the characteristics of the two types of leasing can vary, in general the primary objective of a fina ncial leasing contract is the financing of the acquisition of a vehicle, leading to ownership of the vehicle by the lessee, whereas in the case of an operational leasing contract it is the use of the vehicle and therefore it has some elements in common wit h a rental contract. \nOn one hand, a  financial lease is a financial product that functions as a loan by the lessor to enable the lessee to purchase a v ehicle and pay in instalments. Therefore, in a financial lease contract it is generally the lessee that bears the operational and residual value risk of the vehicle.  \nOn the other hand, i n an  operational leasing  contract , the economic and legal ownership of the vehicle  remains with the lessor  and the lessee pays monthly instalments for its use . Therefore, in an operational lease contract it is generally t he lessor who bear s the risks attached to the property of the vehicle (including in particular , changes to the value of the vehicle  and its disposal at the end of the contract)."

    "text": "On the basis of the evidenc e gathered during its investigation, and in line with the arguments of the Notifying Party, the Commission finds that each individual HPS component constitutes a separate product market. First , on the demand side , individual HPS components such as pumps,  valves, or motors, are differentiated product s which perform a specific functio n within the system, and which are, typically not substitutable with one another . In the first place , as explained in recitals  0-(45) above, each  component serves a specific purpose and, with few exceptions, cannot be replaced by other products. T he pump generates flow, which in turn creates pressure in the hydraulic system. Th e motor or actuator  converts that pressure into  mechanical force or torque. A reservoir holds hydraulic fluid. Valves are used to control the flow of hydraulic fluid in the HPS by opening, closing or partially closing the pathway of the hydraulic fluid. In the second place , the fact that each component  serves a different purpose is complemented by the fact that the market investigation suggests that customers appear to have a tendency to procure such components individually. While  in some instances customers may choose to procure more than one product a s a system from a supplier, components from separate suppliers are often used in combination with each other and integrated in -house by the customer, as evidenced in recital  (56) below."

This is confirmed by the fact that, according to the Notifying Party\u2019s own estimates , the market shares for HSUs in the EEA over the past three years are similar whether in -house production by OEMs is included or excluded.

Technically,  they are distinct. HSUs uses pressurised hydraulic fluid generated by pumps to move an actuator (cylinder) that moves the wheels. Electrohydraulic steering, on the other hand, is still hydraulically powered but electronically controlled, for example by a joystick. Electrohydraulic steering can be achieved through an ESV which converts the hydraulic oil to the cylinders in proportion to the electronic input signal. The Notifying Party notes that \u201c [c]ompared to Hydraulic Steering, Electrohydraulic Steering is technically more advanced in that it provides steering by a joystick and similar electronic input devices as well as GPS auto -guidance functionality.

In electric steering the power -assist is generated by electric motors, rather than via hydraulic power as is the case for hydraulic stee ring systems. Electric steering systems eliminate the need for hydraulic components such as an HSU, pumps, hoses and a drive belt connected to the engine.

Second, the Commission has previously considered whether the life -insurance market would appropriately be segmented between life insurance for individuals and life insurance for group/corporate customers. Third, the Commission has considered distinguishing between life insurance products based on the type of risk covered. When considering potential segmentation based on the type of risk covered, the Commission\u2019s approach has varied from case to case, based on insurance classifications used by the regulatory framework applicable at national level. Specifically in relation to the insurance sector in Poland, the Commission has considered a possible segmentation of the life insurance market on the basis of the classification under the Polish Insurance Act (\u201cPIA\u201d)."

    "text": "The market investigation in this case suggested that dry leasing may be further segmented according to types of lease. Thus, sale and lease back (\u201cSLB\u201d) is a lease by which an airline is selling to a lessor an aircraft it already has in its fleet or an aircraft it has on order from an aircraft manufacturer (\u201cairframer\u201d) and immediately leases it back from the lessor. In the second type of dry leasing, the lessor is the original owner of the aircraft (for example because it ordered it directly from an airframer). This latter type of leasing is referred to as \u201cdirect\u201d, \u201cspeculative\u201d or \u201cplacement\u201d leasing.\n\nAccording to market participants, SLB and direct leasing are different services from the demand side. SLB\u2019s serve financial needs of airlines; airlines would rely on SLB leasing when they own the aircraft but are looking for more liquidity or to cut capital expenses. Direct leasing serve operational needs: airlines would rely on direct leasing when they need more aircraft but cannot purchase them themselves, for example because the time to order them directly from airframes is too long or when they cannot order them directly from the airframers.\n\nFrom the supply side, direct leasing represents higher risk for lessors compared to SLBs because, unlike with SLBs, with direct leasing the lessor bears the risk of finding a lessee for the aircraft. In addition, ordering aircraft directly from airframers is highly complicated and requires very specific expertise that only a minority of lessors have. While more than 150 lessors are active in SLB, only about 15 -20 are regularly active in direct dry leasing.\n\nRates to be paid for SLBs and direct leases are also different. While the rate of SLB is primarily based on the price of the aircraft paid by the airline offering it for SLB, the rates of direct leases are based on the balance of demand and supply for the aircraft at the time it is leased."

    "text": "In accordance with the Commission practice mentioned above, a further segmentation by type of aircraft should be considered also with respect to the two types of dry leasing. Another possible distinction is between passenger and non-passenger (or cargo) aircraft that serve different demand needs.\n\nSpecifically in relation to direct dry leasing, market participants explained that direct leasing of wide body aircraft represent a higher risk to lessors compared to leasing of narrow body aircraft. Wide body aircraft are three times more expensive than narrow body aircraft and demand for them is much smaller than for narrow body aircraft. Consequently, it is more difficult for lessors to find a lessee for wide body aircraft. Another significant difficulty, when the lessor seeks to replace a lessee, is re-branding. When an aircraft changes from one airline to another, it has to be re-fitted in order to comply with the branding of the new airline. Wide body aircraft are more expensive to re-brand not only because they are bigger but also because airlines invest significantly more in branding their premium classes that are usually served by wide body aircraft, an investment that is not typically made in narrow body aircraft. Consequently, out of about 15-20 lessors regularly active in direct dry leasing, only about five to ten are considered to be regularly active in the dry leasing of wide body aircraft."

Brokerage distribution is generally required by large corporations that require professional broker advice and complex customized insurance solutions when insuring large and complex risks. In previous Decisions , the Commission has considered the distribution of insurance via brokers as a separate product market, as most customers consider that the other channels are not substitutes for brok erage services. The Commission has previously identified a market for the distribution of insurance products, but has left open the question of whether this market includes only outward channels, or both outward chan nels and pure direct distribution. However, for the purposes of this Decision, only a market for insurance distr ibution including both outward channels and pure direct distribution is relevant as both Allianz and Aviva Italia are each involved in pure direct distribution only (they do not distribute third-party products ). The remainder of this Decision therefore refers to a plausible market for direct insurance distribution including both pure direct distribution and other outward channels . The Commission previously considered that a distinction could be made between the distribution of (i) life and (ii) non- life insurance products , as different providers tend to be involved and the distribution of life insurance in Europe is regulated separately from other types of insurance but ultimately left the exact product market definition open ."

The Commission considers that, following the closing of the sale of the Divestment Business, the financial position of DCL will be comparable with that of its peers. Additionally, DCL has modified existing credit arrangements with external debt providers, reinforcing the covenants so tha t they will require DCL to preserve a financially sound position in the coming years. The covenants ensure that DCL will not distribute equity in any form to its owners before the largest part of its long terms debt is refinanced under similar conditions t o the current arrangements. The Commission considers that external debt providers have incentives to enforce the strengthened covenants towards DCL, as greater amounts of equity reduce the risk to debt holders. In addition, the Commission views positively that in absolute terms the capital expenditure by DCL has been stable and increasing in the past.

In particular, as regards demand -side substitutability, special bisphenol for polycarbonate resins fulfil specific functions, and provide specific characteristics, such as heat resistance and durability, to polycarbonate resins that other special bisphenols (or other types of bisphenols), such as special bisphenol for epoxy resins, do not provide.\n\nAs regards a potential narrower market definition, distinguishing between each individual type of special bisphenol for polycarbonate resin, the Commission observes that while there appears to be some degree of substitutability between various categories of special bisphenols for polycarbonate resins, important price- differences among these categories of products would point towards the absence of complete demand- side substitutability, at least for some categories of customers. As regards supply- side substitutability, the Commission notes that the Notifying Parties acknowledge that it is not always possible to switch production easily between certain types of special bisphenol for polycarbonate resins (and in particular it is not possible to switch production between BisOPPEO-FL and other types of special bisphenol for polycarbonate resins).\n\nThe market investigation did not indicate that the market for special bisphenols for polycarbonate resins could be broader, so as to include other special bisphenols, or should be further segmented.\n\nIn any event, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this decision, the precise question of whether the relevant product market (i) comprises all special bisphenols, (ii) comprises only special bisphenols for polycarbonate resins or (iii) is segmented between all individual types of special bisphenols for polycarbonate resins listed in paragraph (14) (Table 1) above can be left open, as these alternative product market definitions do not affect the outcome of the competitive assessment of the Transaction as to its compatibility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement."

    "topic": "Retail supply of \u2018green\u2019 electricity",
    "text": "The Commission agrees that, at the presen t stage, narrower markets for the retail supply of green electricity are not warranted  in Belgium, for the following reasons.\nThe Belgian federal energy regulator, the Commission for Electricity and Gas Regulation (\u2018CREG\u2019), told the Commission that it considers green energy to be an element of competition rather than a separate market and that it has not seen a particular increase in the number of green electricity contracts being offered.\nFrom the demand side, six of the 12 small I&C customers responding to the Commission\u2019s market investigation replied that green electricity should be considered a separate segment of the market, with five of those respondents stating that they are ready to pay a higher price for green electricity. However, most of the competitors and customers who responded to the questionnaires confirmed that price is the most important factor by which customers select their electricity supplier, and only two of the customers ranked the type of electricity (green) amongst the two most important factors and none of the competitors did so.\nFrom the supply-side, all competitors responding to the market investigation indicated that the supply of green energy should not be considered a separate segment of the retail market, with two competitors commenting that \u201c [g]reen energy is likely to be another element of co mpetition rather than a separate market\u201d  and \u201c[g]reen electricity is an additional product attribute a supplier can offer to its customers, but doesn\u2019t justify to be a separate segment per se \u201d. All respondents to the market investigation have indicated that they already supply at least some green electricity. This can be done either by producing green electricity themselves or by purchasing GoOs. GoOs allow for the traceability of the electricity that is purchased by a supplier on the wholesale market and offer the guarantee that a quantity of electricity equivalent to the certificate has been produced using a renewable energy source. The prices of such certificates are reflected on the invoice sent to the customer but only represent a limited propor tion of the final price of electricity. In Belgium, in 2020, the increase was of 0.70 EUR/MWh. By way of illustration, the average yearly electricity consumpti on of an average household is 3.5 MWh. Its impact in the final price is thus insignificant. This means, on the one hand, that customers that opt for \u201cgreen electricity\u201d contracts do not necessarily need to pay a significantly higher price than customers that choose non-green contracts, and second, that suppliers can start offering gr een electricity or expanding their current offer without the need to adjust any production or distribution assets, make additional investments (other than the cost of purchasing of GoOs) or incur in any time delays.\nTherefore, even if for some customers gr een and \u201cnon-green\u201d electricity were not completely substitutable, the effects of supply-side substitutability could be seen as equivalent to those of demand substitution in terms of effectiveness and immediacy, since suppliers are able to switch to the relevant products and market them in the short term."

However almost all competitors submitted that a supplier of visual CPQ solutions speciali sed on specific items within the residential interior design space (e.g. , K&B) could start offering such software for other items (e.g. , furniture) timely and at no significant costs even if one competitor pointed out that K&B furniture is \u201c usually more complex, therefore more expensive\u201d compared to other furniture \u201c which needs les s functionalities\u201d.\n\nIn that context , some competitors also pointed out that such switch between industry verticals may require some efforts as they considered that getting access to the relevant catalogue content for the new residential interior items is an important necessary step .

Finally, the Commission has also considered in past decisions potential distinct markets for engineering services on public lighting, including street and public place lighting, traffic signals, and the illumination of places, monuments and buildings, distinguishing between installation and maintenance services.\nThe Parties generally agree with the Commission\u2019s practice, without taking a firm view on the exact product market definition. Within the provision of engineering services for power lines, however, the Parties indicate that a possible further sub-distinction could be made between overhead and underground power lines. The Commission\u2019s decisional practice has not considered such a distinction.\nThe market investigation showed that competitors were divided as to whether the provision of electrical services to infrastructures should be further segmented (e.g. distinguishing, for instance, between installation/maintenance of public lighting infrastructure, installation/maintenance of power lines, etc.), although the majority of customers that expressed a view considered that no further segmentation would be necessary.\nHowever, when it comes to the provision of engineering services for power lines, the majority of competitors and customers were of the view that it was appropriate to distinguish by type of voltage (between high \u2013 above 50 000 volts, and medium/low \u2013 below 50 000 volts ). One competitor, for instance, indicated as follows: \u201cHigh voltage request specific plant, heavy equipment, staff & labor force being highly trained, not necessary for low or medium voltage. Profile of workers, equipment, software, plant are completely different \u201d. Other customers expressed similar opinions, and one of them stated that whereas there are some companies specialised in the provision of services for high -voltage lines, others cover the whole range of services.\nAs to a possible distinction between services concerning, on one hand, the installation and, on the other hand, the maintenance of power lines, all competitors that expressed a view indicated that they carry out both installation and maintenance works. A slight majority of customers indicated that they contract installation and maintenance services in the same contract and that most contractors cover both types of works. One customer explained that installation and maintenance are very similar, that they often involve the same type of works, only with a difference in their urgency, and that the staff and resources employed by companies can be used in both."

    "text": "In its previous decisions, the Commission has considered that the geographic scope of electrical engineering markets was at least national, although the precise definition was ultimately left open. While it is true that in one case concerning France the Commission considered both national and regional shares due to the existence of national players, the market investigation in that same case suggested that the geographic scope for the provision of services to power lines was most likely national because the competitive conditions were similar throughout France.\nThe Notifying Party considers the markets to be, at least, national in scope.\nIn the market investigation, the majority of competitors were of the view that companies active in electrical engineering services are typically present at national level and that prices are essentially the same throughout the national territory. The majority also indicated that the market for the installation/maintenance of electrical infrastructures should be viewed as national, with one competitor even indicating that it could be even EEA -wide or wider. The majority of customers also agreed that most companies active in electrical engineering services are present at national level. One of the main customers in Spain also stated that \u201c most of our suppliers of electrical engineering services cover the national territory. Some big corporations may have companies that operate in different countries \u201d. The replies provided by customers were also inconclusive as to whether quoted prices differ significantly in different areas within Spain and/or France. One of the main customers in Spain explained that \u201c prices show very little variation from one region to another. These variations might be slightly higher in islands with respect to continental territory, due to the location and isolation \u201d. In any case, the majority of customers also consider that the market is national.\nIn conclusion, according to the market investigation the geographic scope of the provision of electrical engineering services, in particular for power lines, is most likely national although, for the purposes of this Decision, it can be left open whether the market should be defined as national or regional, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under either geographic market definition."

Some Commission precedents also considered that separate markets may exist based on a combination of the closures\u2019 material and end -use (e.g. , plastic beverage closures or aluminium beverage closures).\nIn the present case, the market investigation suggests that it may be appropriate to distinguish closures made from different materials and, in particular, that aluminium and plastic closures may belong to separate markets.

    "topic": "Oceanic Cruises Product Market",
    "text": "In its previous decisions, the Commission has considered the market for the supply of oceanic cruises to be distinct from the market for the supply of coastal ferry or riverine cruises, and also separate from the market for the supply of other (land-based) holidays. The Commission considered that within the overall oceanic cruises market, it is possible to distinguish between contemporary, premium, luxury and expedition cruises. Contemporary cruise lines comprise the largest portion of the oceanic cruise operation industry and operate the largest cruise ships. This is the more mass-market end of the market typically serving families and couples of all ages. Premium cruises are offered on smaller vessels and target families seeking a more high-end experience, middle-aged and senior couples, and senior travellers. Luxury and expedition cruises typically offer longer, more exclusive and luxurious travel experiences including off-the-beaten track destinations such as the Arctic and Antarctic/South America. The majority of respondents to the Commission\u2019s market investigation in this case confirmed this approach and the Notifying Parties agree with it. For the purpose of this decision, it is not necessary to conclude on whether an overall market for oceanic cruises has to be considered or whether the market should be segmented into different product markets according to cruise types, as under any of these plausible segmentations, the Transaction would not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market."

The Notifying Parties argue that the geographic market definition should be at least EEA-wide. According to the Notifying Parties, cruise operators can choose cruise terminals from a wide geographic area because cruise passengers can travel to and from the ports of origin and destination, as do about half of cruise passengers from the United Kingdom. Respondents to the Commission\u2019s market investigation confirmed that some passengers, most notably in the premium and luxury / expedition segments, do not mind travelling to and from the ports of origin and destination, allowing cruise operators flexibility in the choice of terminals. However, as is evident in the figures adduced by the Notifying Parties, respondents also explained that a significant proportion of passengers, mostly in the contemporary segment, prefers not to travel long distances to the cruise terminals. It is essential to offer these passengers cruises that start and terminate in their home countries.

The first level (ATC 1) is the most general and the fourth level (ATC 4) the most detailed. More specifically, the Commission referred to the ATC3 level, where pharmaceuticals are grouped in terms of their therapeutic indications, i.e. their intended use, as the starting point for defining the relevant product market, since these groups of products generally have the same therapeutic indication and cannot be substituted by products belonging to other ATC 3 classes.\nHowever, the Commission also recognized that it may be appropriate, if the circumstances of the case show that competitive constraints make it necessary, to carry out analyses at the more detailed ATC4 level, or possibly at the level of groups of molecules or individual molecules. Relevant factors to take into account include therapeutic (e.g. prescription only, or administration allowed only under medical supervision) or pharmacological criteria such as molecule class, formulation or mode of administration (e.g. topical versus systemic).\nThe Notifying Party suggests to follow this approach in the present case. It submits that its products fall into the C4A, N2B, N4A, N5A, N6A, N5B, N5C and N6D classifications at ATC3 level and into the C4A1, N2B0, N4A0, N5A1, N5A9, N5B1, N6A9, N5C0 and N6D 0 classifications at ATC4 level.\nIn any event, for the purposes of this Decision, it is not necessary to conclude on the exact product market definition for FDPs for the treatment of CNS disorders, as, regardless of the market definition considered, the Transaction does not give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA agreement."

Second, from a supply-side perspective, CDMO services at the API and FDP levels do not involve the same equipment and require specific know-how and expertise. The Commission has found in the past that multiple CDMO players do not have the capability to be active throughout the CDMO value chain and are exclusively active either at the API level or at the FDP level.\nAs regards the CDMO market for FDPs, further segmentations were considered in relation to (i) the pharmaceutical form manufactured (e.g. solids, semi-solids, injectables), (ii) the conditions of manufacture (toxicity, sterile environment, etc.), (iii) the type of API used for its production and the delivery mechanism used (swallowing, intravenous, injection, etc.).

The Notifying Party submits that flame retardants should be sub-segmented according to the chemistry used, for example: (i) brominated; (ii) chlorinated; (iii) aluminium tri-hydroxide based; and (iv) phosphorus based. It argues that it would not be appropriate to sub-segment the market further based on end application, for example for use in: (i) PVC; (ii) polyamides; or (iii) polyurethane ('PU'); because the same type of flame retardants can be used for different applications and different types of flame retardants can be used for the same application. The Commission has previously noted that flame retardants can differ depending on the chemistry used or on the basis of the application but that manufacturers of flame retardants can use different inputs to achieve flame retardants with comparable characteristics. The Commission found that the market could potentially be sub-segmented by type but it ultimately left the market definition open, undertaking the assessment based on the market broken down by chemistry and end application. The market investigation was inconclusive as to whether it would be appropriate to further segment the market according to chemistry used. The vast majority of respondents consider that flame retardants based on different chemistries can be used for the same end applications in some cases, but not all. In turn, the market investigation was also inconclusive as to whether it could be appropriate to sub-segment either phosphorus or bromine based flame retardants according to end use. The vast majority of respondents consider that products based on a particular chemistry are partially interchangeable in that they can be used for some end-applications, but not all. In particular, a slight majority consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PVC applications and the majority of respondents consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PU applications. A horizontally affected market arises in relation to bromine based flame retardants and a few market participants raised concerns regarding phosphorus based flame retardants which are therefore considered below in the competitive assessment. For the purpose of the present decision, the exact scope of the product market definition for flame retardants and its sub-segments therein can be left open, since no serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market arise, regardless of whether the market is considered to be broken down by chemistry or further broken down by end application."

    "topic": "Butyl Acetate (BuAc) Product Market",
    "text": "In the past, the Commission found that the market for BuAc should be subdivided into its isomers (same chemical formula but different chemical structures) which are isobutyl acetate (\u201ciso-BuAc\u201d) and n-butyl acetate (\u201cn-BuAc\u201d). Specifically for n-BuAc, the Commission also examined the possibility to sub-segment the market by purity grade, between normal grade n-BuAc with a purity of 99.0% and high purity grade n-BuAc with a purity of at least 99.5%, but ultimately left this question open.\nThe Notifying Party submits that iso-BuAc and n-BuAc form part of the same market, because on the supply-side, switching production between these two products is very easy and can be done in a matter of hours for producers equipped with the proper manufacturing equipment. For a producer not yet able to manufacture both products, additional equipment for the production of both isomers would only require a limited investment, around EUR [500 000 - 1.5 million] . From the demand-side, the Notifying Party claims that n-BuAc and iso-BuAc are, to some extent, interchangeable, as they are mainly used by the same industries and for the same purposes, but still acknowledges that there are a number of specific iso-BuAc applications that cannot use n-BuAc.\nAs regards a potential segmentation of n-BuAc by purity grade, the Notifying Party explains that it was considered in case M.7858 \u2013 INEOS / Celanese assets because at that time, [differentiating between purity grades was more common than it is today] . The Notifying Party therefore submits that the segmentation of n-BuAc by purity grade is no longer relevant.\nFinally, the Notifying Party underlines that in the context of the assessment of a vertical relationship with acetic acid (upstream), the precise scope of the relevant downstream product market can be left open because all potential segmentations of the market for BuAc require acetic acid for their manufacture in identical amounts, proportions and quality.\nProducers of BuAc overwhelmingly support the view that iso-BuAc and n-BuAc form two distinct product markets.\nThe market investigation was inconclusive as to the substitutability between normal grade n-BuAc with a purity of 99.0% and high purity grade n-BuAc with a purity of at least 99.5%. While confirming that production of different purity grades within n-BuAc does not require different volumes or qualities of acetic acid, and therefore that acetic acid does not represent a different proportion of the overall manufacturing costs for different purity grades within n-BuAc, the market investigation clearly showed that BuAc producers consider that switching between producing the two purity grades costs considerable time and effort and constitutes a major strategic decision.\nReplies to the market investigation confirm the argument of the Notifying Party that the production of iso-BuAc does not require different volumes or qualities of acetic acid compared to the production of n-BuAc and therefore that acetic acid does not represent a different proportion of the overall manufacturing costs for iso-BuAc compared to n-BuAc.\nIn light of the above, the Commission considers that each of n-BuAc and iso-BuAc constitutes a separate product market. Regarding a possible sub-segmentation of n-BuAc by purity level , the question can be left open, since under any possible product market definition (n-BuAc overall, normal grade n-BuAc with a purity of 99.0% and high purity grade n-BuAc with a purity of at least 99.5%), the Transaction does not give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market."

The Notifying Party also explains that the transportation costs for ACN are low, representing 5% \u2013 10% of the delivery price, and that there are high levels of imports of ACN into the EEA, due to the historic surplus situation in Asia and the USA. Finally, the Notifying Party notes that while the general tariff on ACN from third countries stands at 6,5%, ACN currently falls within an autonomous tariff quota system ( in the EU, such quotas can be opened in some economic sectors in order to stimulate competition inside the EU. They are normally granted to raw materials, semi-finished goods or components not available in the EU in sufficient quantities), whose latest amendment provides for 60kt of ACN per annum (representing around [5-10]% of the total EEA + Turkey consumption) to be imported from third countries tariff-free.\nIn support of the fact that the ACN market cannot be narrower than EEA + Turkey, the Notifying Party explains (i) that ACN is included within the free movement requirements for certain goods as part of the EU-Turkey Customs Union, (ii) that exports of ACN to Turkey represented 53% of the ACN exported from the EEA in 2019, (iii) that Turkey is the leading national consumer of ACN within the EEA+ Turkey area, and its total annual demand is not met by local production, and (iv) that Turkey is home to Aksa, the leading producer of acrylic fibre in the EEA + Turkey area, which is the principal downstream application for ACN, representing approximately [\u2026]% of total use of ACN worldwide.\nRespondents in the market investigation unanimously consider the market for ACN to be worldwide.\nIn any event, the Commission considers that the question of whether the relevant geographic market for ACN is worldwide, EEA + Turkey, or EEA can be left open, since the Transaction does not give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market, under any of these three possible geographic market definitions."

In previous decisions regarding the Austrian and Finnish market, the Commission has found that cash & carry stores form part of a distinct product market for cash & carry sales of daily consumer goods. The Notifying Party considers the relevant product market for this Transaction to be retail sale of daily consumer goods mainly carried out by retail outlets. They do not consider further segmentations plausible, as supermarkets, hypermarkets and discount chains are in direct competition. The product market definition applied by the Commission in previous cases is also relevant for Poland. The relevant product market for the purposes of this decision is therefore the retail market for daily consumer goods limited to modern distribution channels (hypermarkets, supermarkets and discounters)."

In line with previous decisional practice, the Notifying Party considers the catchment areas of the local markets to be 20 -30 minutes driving time. Considering local circumstances, the Notifying Party considers the relevant catchment areas to be bigger in rural areas compared to non- rural areas, as the lower population density necessitates longer travel distances. Thus, in non- rural areas, the Parties consider the narrowest local markets to be catchment areas where consumers can reach outlets within approximately 20 minutes driving time. In rural areas, the Parties consider that the narrowest local markets to be catchment areas where consumers can reach outlets within approximately 30 minutes driving time. For the purpose of this decision, in line with previous decisions and, in particular, based on the findings in precedent M.4522, the relevant geographic markets for the retail sale of daily consumer goods via modern distribution channels in Poland are therefore considered to be the local markets with a radius of 20- 30 minutes driving time."

Furthermore, the Commission has considered, but ultimately left open, a further segmentation between retail and institutional clients (such as pension funds, banks or insurance companies). Within the potential segment of institutional clients, the Commission has considered in previous cases a further segmentation between active and passive asset management. In active asset management, an asset manager aims at outperforming a benchmark such as an index, whereas in passive asset management, the asset manager aims at replicating the performance of an index. Regarding retail clients, the Com mission has previously considered a segmentation between open retail funds, with no restriction on the number of investors, and closed retail funds, which are tailor -made for a small group of investors. For all these plausible segmentations, the Commission ultimately left open the precise product market definition."

From a demand -side perspective, the majority of respondents indicated that users do not consider other wearable devices, in particular connected rings, earwear and eyewear, as substitutes for wrist -worn wearable devices, namely. smartwatches and fitness trackers. Respondents explained that the devices specific to different body parts have different functions.

Respondents to the market investigation emphasised that wearable OSs are customised products, which are specifically designed for wearable devices. From a demand -side perspective, it is not possible for an OEM to simply transfer an OS for PCs, smart TVs or smart mobile devices onto wearable devices. While it is possible and common to adapt OSs for smart mobile devices for use on wearable devices (for example iOS, Android OS), this requires a significant level of customisation. From a supply -side perspective, the majority of respondents also indicated that a supplier of an OS for smart mobile device could not develop and start offering in the short term and without undertaking significant investment an OS for wearable devices. For the same reasons, and based on the results of the market investigation, the Commission considers that OSs for wrist -worn wearable devices, which are relevant in the context of the Transaction, constitute a separate product market from OSs for non -wrist -worn wearable devices."

For instance, while Apple\u2019s iOS and Fitbit\u2019s proprietary OSs [Fitbit OS 1] and [Fitbit OS 2] have always been non -licensable, Google\u2019s Android OS and Wear OS have always been licensable. The majority of respondents to the market investigation confirmed that suppliers of non -licensable OS are unlikely to start licensing their OS to third -party OEMs, mentioning in particular Apple as example.

Moreover, the Commission considers that there are separate markets for app stores for a given OS platform of wearable devices. From an end user demand -side perspective, the majority of respondents to the market investigation indicated that customers cannot choose between different app stores for their devices running on Wear OS and Fitbit OSs. Google Play is the only app store via which users can download apps onto their Wear OS devices. The Fitbit App Gallery is the only app store via which users can download apps onto their Fitbit devices. From an app developer perspective, Google Play and the Fitbit App Gallery therefore provide access to a different customer group, i.e. to users of Wear OS devices and users of Fitbit devices, respectively. From a supply side perspective, in line with the Google Android case, the Commission notes that smart mobile device OEMs are unlikely to switch app stores, as they would need to switch to another licensable OS thereby incurring significant costs. The development costs can be substantial, making it unlikely that an OEM would change OS merely due to a degradation of the wearable app store. OEMs are also unlikely to do so because their users would incur costs when switching to a different OS and app store. These switching costs include the need to download and purchase existing apps for the new wearable OS, the need to learn and become familiar with a new interface and the need to transfer data through often inconvenient and imperfect mechanisms."

    "text": "Contrary to the submission by the Notifying Parties, market participants appear to have a common understanding of different container ship categories based on size (delineated by TEU capacity in particular). This holds specifically for categories reported on by industry publication Clarkson s Research, namely: Feeder (<3  000 TEU), Intermediate (3 -7 999 TEU), Neo -Panamax (8 -11 999 TEU), Neo -Panamax (12-14 999 TEU ), and Post-Panamax (15  000+ TEU). A majority  of customers and competitors expressing their opinion submit that these categories are regularly relied upon in interactions between shipbuilders and customers. While one customer states that \u2018 [t]he size categories seem to be unrelated to the interactions between shipbuilders and customers \u2019, another customer explains that these \u2018 categories refer[\u2026] to the typical classification in the shipping industry when shipbu ilders interact with their customers \u2019.  A further customer agrees and submits that these \u2018definitions are very common in the market recognized by most majority of the people involved in the industry \u2019. Yet another customer says that \u2018 [s]ubject to vessel design and trade requirements, proposed category looks reasonable and corresponds to common industry practice \u2019. Competitors agree, with one stating that \u2018 [t]hese categories are usually used in discussions with customers, classification societies, etc. \u2019 and another one calling them \u2018 [w]orld standard \u2019."

The Commission has considered that individual premium sports channels do not form a separate market even if they show sports content that is particularly interesting to the same group of viewers .\nIn any event, for the purpose of this decision, the exact product market definition for the wholesale supply of TV channels can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market regardless of whether the market is segmented on the basis of channel genre or between FTA TV channels and premium/basic pay TV channels."

    "topic": "Assessment of Euronext's independence from the parties involved in the merger",
    "text": "According to paragraph 12(a) of the Borsa Italiana Commitments, the Proposed Purcha ser must be independent of and unconnected to the Parties and their Affiliated Undertakings. The Commission considers that Euronext meets this requirement for the following reasons.\nFirst , with respect to the structural links between the Parties and Euronext, the Commission notes that the Notifying Party submits that Euronext is independent and has no connection to LSEG (including Refinitiv) , other than a non -controlling minority shareholding in LCH S.A , and that neither Euronext nor any of its affiliates is economically dependent on either of the Parties. LSEG further submits that (i) neither of the Parties nor any of their subsidiaries have direct or indirect ownership interests in Euronext or any of its affiliates, and that (ii) no director of either of the Parties or any of their subsidiaries is on the board of Euronext or any of its affiliates.\nThe Commission considers that Euronext is independent from the Parties despite its 11.1% minority shareholding in LCH S.A. for the following reasons. Indeed, although its shareholding entitles Euronext to appoint one representative to the Board, to the Audit Committee and to the Risk Committee of LCH S.A., it does not confer joint control to Euronext over LCH S.A within the meaning of Article 3 of the Merger Re gulation . This is because Euronext has neither equality in voting rights or appointment to decision -making bodies, nor veto rights over decisions which are essential for the strategic commercial behaviour of LCH S.A. despite its right to appoint one repres entative to the Board, which take strategic commercial decisions, Euronext does not have the possibility to veto these strategic decisions in light of the fact that (i) LCH S.A.\u2019s Board\u2019s decisions are taken by simple majority vote, except for certain topi cs ([\u2026] services provided to Euronext) for which an enhanced (75% of non -conflicted directors) majority is required; and that (ii) LCH S.A \u2019s Board is composed of a minimum of 3 members , and a maximum of 18 members, while the number of the Board members is at the discretion of LCH Group . As Euronext will remain in a minority on the Board, it cannot veto decisions taken by simple majority. While Euronext could potentially veto decision s taken by enhance d majority if LCH\nThe Commission further notes that through direct and indirect shareholding s, Euronext holds a 5.1% share in Euroclear, in which LSEG holds 4.92% . Both Euronext and LSEG are represented at Euroclear\u2019s board of directors. However, given the stakes and rights of other shareholders, LSEG and Euronext cannot exercise control over Euroclear individually or jointly. Therefore, the Commission considers that this co-participation does not affect Euronext\u2019s ability and incentive to act as an independent player on the market.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission considers that Euronext is structurally independent from LSEG.\nThe Commission notes that the above conclusion is consistent with the views expressed by the Trustee in its Reasoned Opinion.\nSecond, with respect to existing commercial relationships, the Commission firstly notes that LCH S.A. provides clearing services for cash and derivatives traded on certain of Euronext\u2019s markets. More specifically, (i) LCH S.A. provides central clearing counterparty (\u201c CCP \u201d) clearing for the full scope of Euronext listed cash and derivative products under two separate agreements for the cash and derivatives markets, and (ii) Oslo B\u00f8rs (owned by Euronext) relies on LCH Ltd. and LCH S.A. to provide CCP services for trades executed on Oslo B\u00f8rs\u2019 cash markets .\nThe Trustee considers that the provision of clearing services by LCH S.A. to Euronext does not alter Euronext\u2019s independence vis -\u00e0-vis the Parties because these services are provided on an arm\u2019s length basis and would continue to be provided on such basis after the proposed Euronext/Borsa Italiana Transaction (namely along the terms of their long -term contract agreed in 2017).\nThe Commission agrees with the Trustee\u2019s view and considers that the provision of clearing services by LCH S.A. to Euronext does not alter Euronext\u2019s independence vis-\u00e0-vis the Parties given that, inter alia, these existing commercial relationships are standard connectivity agreement s for clearing purposes that are common practice in the industry , which have been concluded at arm's length. The Commission also notes that, for the sake of completeness, LSEG e xplained that subject to its contractual arrangements with LCH S.A., Euronext ha s the right to migrate its clearing business to another clearing house [\u2026]. It follows that Euronext cannot be considered to be economically dependent on LSEG as a result of th is existing commercial relationship between Euronext and LCH S.A."

    "text": "According to paragraph 12(b) of the Borsa Italiana Commitments, the Proposed Purchaser must have the financial resources to maintain and develop the Divestment Business as a viable and active competitive force in competition with the Parties and other comp etitors. The Commission considers that Euronext has the financial resources to acquire, maintain and develop the Divestment Business as a viable and active competitive force for the following reasons.\nAt the outset, the Commission notes that, based on the feedback provided by market participants during the Commission\u2019s market test of the Commitments offered by the Notifying Party (during the phase II investigation of case M.9564 \u2013 LSEG/Refinitiv), Euronext appears to be able to ensure the viability and competitiveness of the Divestment Business. The vast majority of market participants that responded to the Market Test indeed believed that the proposed sale of the Divestment Business to Euronext will ensure the viability and competitiveness of the Divestmen t Business. More specifically, 83% of trading venues, 57% of clearing houses, and 48% of customers that responded to the Market Test consider that the Divestment of Borsa Italiana to Euronext will not alter the viability and competitiveness of the Divestme nt Business. As above, out of the 61 customers, 6 clearing houses, and 8 trading venues who responded, only one customer considers that the proposed divestment of Borsa Italiana does not ensure the viability and competitiveness of the Divestment Business. By way of example, TP ICAP, a trading venue competitor, indicated that \u201c Maintaining the integrity of the divested assets and management structure provide sufficient guarantees of viability and competitiveness even in the new acquiring structure \u201d and BME , ano ther trading competitor mentioned that the purchaser \u201c will acquir[e] all EGB business of LSE (MTS, Monte Titoli, CC&G) and together they can continue as a viable competitor\u201d . With regard to customers, for instance, BANCA SELLA HOLDING\nAs regards financial resources, Euronext is a publicly listed company with a market capitalisation of EUR 6 - 7 billion. In 2020, Euronext achieved revenues of EUR 872 million , under a very profitable business model, wi th EBITDA margins of almost 60% and EBIT margins still above 50% for all of the past 7 fiscal years . As noted in the Reasoned Opinion, Euronext\u2019s sources of revenues are diversified across the businesses, markets and client segments, and its business mode l has proven to be resilient to cris es. Furthermore, Euronext \u2019s financial documentation shows a strong balance sheet with a Net Debt/EBITDA of 1.2x . As a result, the group\u2019s pre -Borsa Italiana debt facilities were rated \u201cA -\u201d, i.e. solid investment grade, by Standard & Poor\u2019s in October 2020.\nThe purchase price agreed between Euronext and LSEG for the sale of the Divestment Business is EUR 4.325 billion, in addition to interest on the purchase price since the locked -box date of 20 June 2020 of EUR [\u2026] (assuming that Closing takes place on [\u2026]). In addition, in the second quarter of 2021 ; approximately EUR\nEuronext will finance the acquisition through a EUR [\u2026] bridge loan facility (consisting of a EUR [\u2026] bridge -to-equity facility and a EUR [\u2026] bridge -to-bond facility) . [\u2026]. This amount is sufficient to cover the payment of the EUR 4.325 billion purchase price at Closing plus the additional sums due . Euronext intends to repay both tranches of the bridge loan facility within [\u2026] following the acquisition of the Divestment Business through a capital increase of Euronext (including the Divestment Business , which Euronext wil l have acquired by then ) and a bond placement. The capital increase will comprise a private placement of circa 8.4% of the shares of Euronext (including the Divestment Business, which Euronext will have acquired by then) in favour of the Italian financial institution CDP Equity S.p.A. (circa 7.3%), and Intesa SanPaolo S.p.A. (circa 1.3% post-dilution ). Through that capital increase, [\u2026]. The proceeds will be used to immediately repay part of the [\u2026] facility.\nIn addition, Euronext intends to use [\u2026] cash on hand available on 31 March 2021 to fund (i) the repayment of Borsa Italiana\u2019s EUR [\u2026], (ii) the transaction costs in the order of EUR [\u2026] as well as (iii) remaining purchase price elements, if not covered in full by the proceeds from the above -mentioned capital increase.\nIt results from the above that Euronext has already taken all steps to ensure that it will be able t o meet its financial commitments in the context of the purchase of the Divestment Business.\nThe Commission notes that, while Euronext will see its net Debt/EBITDA ratio increase from 1.2x to 3.4x with the Euronext/Borsa Italiana Transaction, the Trustee submits that even a debt level of 3.4x is not endangering Euronext\u2019s financial stability when considering its solid revenue s, EBITDA and cash generation. Similarly, the Commission notes that while S&P as well as Euronext\u2019s analysts expect Euronext\u2019s post -Closing rating to be reduced by two notches to \u201cBBB\u201d , the Trustee considers that a \u201cBBB\u201d rate is still an investment grade rating , and that losing investment grade would still be two further notches away.\nIn this re gard, t he Trustee further concludes that Euronext has developed a compelling refinancing plan ensuring that the group\u2019s post -merger debt burden will be manageable and that, as a result, it expects that neither Euronext nor the\nThe Commission agrees with the Trustee\u2019s analysis and conclusions regarding Euronext\u2019s sufficient financial resources to consummate the acquisition of the Divestment Business. The Commiss ion further considers, consistent with the Trustee\u2019s conclusion, that Euronext will also have financial resources to maintain and develop the Divestment Business as a viable and active competitive force in competition with the Parties and other competitors , as the debt burden imposed on the entity resulting from the purchase of the Divestment Business by Euronext will be manageable and the Divestment Business has a strong cash -generating profile.\nIn addition, the Commission notes that Euronext\u2019s detailed bu siness plan for Borsa Italiana stand -alone and the merged group post -Closing depicts that the strategic rationale for the proposed Euronext/Borsa Italian a Transaction translates into significant synergy potential and enhanced value of the combined entity. The proposed Euronext/Borsa Italian a Transaction thus further strengthens Borsa Italiana\u2019s already compelling competitive position and adds to its viability as well as the viability of the merged group in the European market.\nFollowing a detailed review of the Borsa Italiana business, Euronext foresees a [\u2026] revenue growth per annum between 2019 -2024. Between 2019 and 2024, (i) Capital markets are expected to grow at a [\u2026] per annum ; (ii) Post -trade activities (excluding CCP net interest incomes ) are expect ed to grow by [\u2026] on the back of volumes at CC&G and on the back of additional growth of Monte Titoli; (iii) Information services are expected to grow by [\u2026] per annum [\u2026]; (iv) Technology services are expected to grow by [\u2026] per annum . In addition, stand -alone, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow [\u2026] CAGR between 2019 and 2024 before any synergies."

    "text": "Accor ding to paragraph 12 (b) of the Borsa Italiana Commitments, the Proposed Purchaser must have the proven expertis e to maintain and develop the Divestment Business as a viable and active competitive force in competition with the Parties and other competitors.\nFirst , Euronext is an established market operator of pan -European market infrastructure, formed 20 years ago, active in a diverse range of financial activities in the EEA and worldwide. Euronext operates six national regulated securities and derivatives markets, namely in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Oslo and Paris, and a regulated derivatives market in B ergen (Norway). Euronext is also engaged in non -regulated activities in 16 countries across the world. Euronext\u2019s area of expertise comprises listing, cash trading, derivatives trading, spot FX trading, power trading, investor services, advanced data servi ces, post -trade and other technologies. As such, Euronext has the proven expertise to maintain and develop a financial market operator.\nSecond, Euronext has relevant experience in a cquiring and integrating into its organisation similar businesses to the D ivestment Business. As shown in its 2019 annual report, s uccessfully executing its acquisitions is a key part of Euronext\u2019s strategic plan. By way of recent example , Euronext has recently acqui red the stock exchange of Oslo, Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS , in 2019 and the Irish Stock Exchange in 2018 . According to Euronext, Irish Stock Exchange\u2019s revenues grew by [\u2026] in 2020, as compared to 2017.\nEuronext has particular experience with connecting independent exchanges to its single trading platform. In its acquisitions, Euronext applies a set of principles, which will also apply to the Divestment Business. The primary principle consists in the integration of the acquired business within Euronext\u2019s federal model, so that it benefits from a harmonised regulatory framework, Euronext\u2019s single order book, as well as Euronext\u2019s single trading platform Optiq. Other principles include associating the acquired business to Euronext\u2019s governance with a view to attributing a role to the acquired company's group management and to the l ocal ecosystem within the combined group and harmonizing insofar as practicable the various policies across the group.\nBy way of practical example, i n March 2018, Euronext expanded its listing franchise, through the acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange. As a result, the trading technology was migrated to Optiq, and core group functions were harmonized to support the overall integration process and achieve the expected synergies. Trading on Optiq went live on Irish markets in February 2019, and resulted i n a [\u2026] increase in order book activity in the first four months after the migration, and a [\u2026] increase after 20 months. As a result, Irish Stock Exchange\u2019s revenues grew by [\u2026] in 2020, as compared to 2017. From a governance point of view, Euronext estab lished a new board of directors with Irish independent local directors. Senior members of the Irish Stock Exchange joined Euronext\u2019s senior leadership team. The CEO of the Irish Stock Exchange has joined the Managing Board of Euronext.\nSimilarly, in the se cond quarter of 2019, Euronext acquired the Norwegian exchange Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS. The trading technology was migrated away from LSEG\u2019s Millennium IT systems to Optiq in 2020. Euronext established a new board of directors with Norwegian independent local direct ors. Senior members of Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS joined Euronext's senior leadership team. The CEO of Oslo B\u00f8rs has joined the Managing Board of Euronext. Euronext has indicated t hat following the migration of Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS to Optiq which was completed in December 202 0, it has [\u2026].\nMoreover, i n its Reasoned Opinion, the Trustee considers that Euronext has built a track record of successful acquisitions and subsequent development of acquired companies, while furthering its geographical reach. The Trustee notes that not only has the geographical footprint of Euronext expanded, but that Euronext also diversified into new asset classes, with the acquisitions of FastMatch (now Euronext FX) in 2017, and of Nord Pool in 2019. The Trustee considers that from its past acquisiti ons, Euronext was able to demonstrate its ability to successfully integrate, develop and grow acquired businesses.\nThird, Euronext has developed a detailed business plan , which was discussed with and received the support of the Italian Government. As mentioned above in paragraph (34), according to the business plan, Euronext has agreed that CDP Equity S.p.A., and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. will becom e long -term shareholders in Euronext and together with Borsa Italiana Group will have an important role in future governance of Euronext. As both CDP Equity S.p.A. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. are well established, reputable and robust Italian financial inst itutions, with an economic and political interest in the Divestment Business\u2019 long -term success, having them among Euronext\u2019s shareholders and as committed members of Euronext\u2019s governance will represent an asset and a guarantee of l ong-term stability for both Euronext and the Divestment Business.\nConsistent with the above analysis, the Commission notes that, i n its Reasoned Opinion, the Trustee considers that Euronext has engaged significant internal and external resources with execution capability demonst rated in previous acquisitions, to proceed with the integration process in a smooth and in a timely manner and to cope with unforeseen challenges along the way. The Trustee is of the view that Euronext has developed a comprehensive view of the Divestment B usiness\u2019 competitive position and based on that, has been able to present a compelling strategy to develop the Divestment Business going forward.\nThe Commission also notes that th e above assessment is in line with market feedback collected in the course o f the remedies market test, where respondents unanimously considered Euronext to be \u201c a suitable purchaser for the Divestment Business, which will be able to successfully maintain and develop the Divestment Business as a viable and active competitive force \u201d.\nThe Commission also notes that this conclusion is in line with the approval decision required under the MTS\u2019 by -"

The supply side of the market comprises TV production companies while the de mand side comprises companies (TV broadcasters or content platform operators) that commission the production of AV content or hire TV production services. On the other hand, this part of the value chain concerns the licensing of (i) broadcasting rights relating to pre -existing AV content, which is made available \u2018off -the-shelf\u2019 by the rights holder, and (ii) broadcasting rights for sports events. The broadcasting rights can belong to either (or a combination of) the rights holder to the TV format, the p roduction company that produced the content, the company that commissioned the production of the content, or a third party distributor to which the rights were licensed by the original owner. Rights holders license rights to TV broadcasters, or content pla tform operators, which retail the content to end -users on a non-linear basis (e.g., SVOD service providers). The Commission has consistently considered that the production of AV content should be distinguished from the licensing of broadcasting rights for AV content. The Commission has also found the product market for the production of TV content to be limited to non -captive TV production, thereby excluding content produced by TV broadcasters for use on their own channels. In addition, in its 2015 case Liberty Global/Corelio/W&W/De Vijver Media , the Commission considered that the market for the production of TV content and the market for licensing of broadcasting rights to TV content could be further segmented depending on the type of TV conten t (that is films, sports or other) or exhibition window (namely SVOD, transaction -based VOD (\u201cTVOD\u201d), Pay Per View (\u201cPPV\u201d), Fist pay TV window, Second pay TV window, FTA), but ultimately left those possible segmentations open. In subsequent cases, the Com mission either did not consider further segmentations or left open the question whether the market for the production of AV content should be further segmented. In particular, the question was left open whether the market for production of general entertai nment TV content should be further segmented: (i) by genre; (ii) between scripted and non -scripted content; and (iii) between commissioned TV production or TV production for -hire. Similarly, the question whether the market for licensing AV content could b e further sub-divided by distinguishing premium and non -premium content, or scripted and non-scripted content was left open."

In addition, in relation to the product market for the production of AV content, the results of the market investigation provided no reason to depart from the Commission\u2019s approach according to which the market is limited to non -captive AV production. Further, a majority of respondents to the market investigation consider that the market for the production of A V content needs to be subdivided by content type or into scripted and non -scripted AV content. The replies were inconclusive as to whether a segmentation by exhibition window would be appropriate. Lastly, the results of the market investigation provided no reason to depart from the Commission\u2019s approach of considering a further segmentation between commissioned TV production or TV production for -hire. Further, in relation to the product market for the licensing of AV content, most of the providers of AV content consider that the market for the licencing of broadcasting rights for pre -produced AV content could be subdivided by content type, in particular: (i) films; (ii) sports; and (iii) other AV content (i.e. all non -sport, non -film content). Further more, potential sub -segments within these content types should be considered including, in particular, the sub -division of \u201cfilm content\u201d into (a) US and (b) non -US films and the subdivision of \"other AV content\" into (a) scripted AV content and (b) unscri pted AV content. Most providers of retail AV services further consider that these segmentations may be appropriate, however few respondents indicate that a segmentation of sports content should be subdivided by sport discipline. Most of the responde nts consider that the market for the licensing of broadcasting rights for pre -produced AV content could be segmented by exhibition windows: (i) subscription video on demand (\"SVOD\"); (ii) transactional video on demand (\"TVOD\"); (iii) pay -per-view (\"PPV\"); (iv) first pay TV window; (v) second pay TV window; and (vi) free -to-air (\"FTA\"). In light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this decision and without prejudice to further investigation by the UOKiK, a relevant market fo r the non -captive production of AV content and a market for the licensing of broadcasting rights for pre -produced AV content has to be considered, while it can be left open whether this relevant product marked needs to be further sub -segmented, as it would not change the outcome of the Commission\u2019s evaluation of the Referral Request."

    "text": "TV broadcasters package the AV content and broadcasting rights for AV content that they have produced in-house or acquired into linear TV channels, which are supplied to retail suppliers of AV services, and then broadcast to end users either on a FTA basis or on a pay TV basis. Ancillary services, such as catch -up TV, have gradually been associated to TV channels in order to complement the TV offering and enhance the viewer experience of traditional linear TV channels. In its past decisional practice, the Commission identified a wholesale market for the supply of TV chann els. Within that market, in certain decisions, the Commission further identified two separate product markets for (i) FTA TV channels, and (ii) pay TV channels. The Commission further stated that within the pay TV channels market, there could be different segments for (i) basic pay TV channels; and (ii) premium pay TV channels, for which end customers pay a premium in addition to their basic subscription fee. In other decisions, the Commission concluded that at the level of the wholesale supply of TV channels there were two separate product markets, one consisting of the wholesale supply of premium pay TV channels and one consisting of the wholesale supply of FTA and basic pay TV channels. In its decision of 24 February 2015 in case M.7194 \u2013 Liberty Global/Corelio/W&W/De Vijver Media , the Commission has considered that, given that (i) FTA channels were mostly supplied together with basic pay TV channels, and (ii) the competitive assessment would remain the same even if FTA channels were regarded as be longing to a separate product market from that of basic pay TV, it was not necessary to make a distinction between FTA and basic pay TV channels on the market for wholesale supply of TV channels in that case. In addition, in previous decisions including its recent decision of 12 November 2019 in case M.9064 \u2013 Telia Company/Bonnier Broadcasting Holding (hereafter Telia/Bonnier ), the Commission considered that there was no need to draw a distinction between linear TV channels and their ancillary services , which are licensed by TV broadcasters to TV distributors along with, or in addition to those linear TV channels. Further, in previous decisions, the Commission examined a number of other potential additional segmentations, including genre or themat ic content (such as sports, films, general entertainment, news, youth, and others), and ultimately left the market definition open in these regards. Last, in Telia/Bonnier , the Commission considered that the market for wholesale supply of TV channels, and any other possible segmentation, should not be further segmented according to the type of infrastructure used for the delivery to the viewer (cable, satellite, terrestrial TV and IPTV)."

    "text": "Most of the providers of AV content consider that FTA TV and pay TV channels form separate relevant product markets. This result of the market investigation is in line with the Commissi on\u2019s past decisional practice. Within pay TV channels, the Commission has previously further distinguished between the markets for basic pay TV channels (that are part of the basic cable or IPTV subscription) and premium pay TV channels (for which en d customers have to pay a premium in addition to their basic subscription fee). However, during the market investigation, providers of retail AV services provided a mixed reply. In particular, several respondents consider that a segmentation in FTA and pa y channels is not appropriate since broadcasters bundle FTA and pay channels into the same package when negotiating with retail providers of AV services. With reference to a segmentation by genre, most of the respondents consider that thematic pay -TV channels of a given genre (such as TVN Turbo) constitute a complement to thematic pay -TV channels of a different genre (such as Polsat News). In particular, respondents indicate that sports channels should be regarded as complementary in respect to other TV channels. Most respondents consider that ancillary services (e.g., TVE, catch -up, PVR, etc.) have gradually been associated to TV channels in order to complement the TV offering and enhance the viewer experience of traditional linear channels. In particular, in the Polish market most of the providers of retail AV services provide both linear and non -linear services with the latter offered either as ancillary rights to linear distribution or as standalone OTT services. Most of the responden ts consider that the market for the wholesale supply of TV channels should not be further segmented according to the distribution forms (e.g. cable, IPTV, satellite, terrestrial, or OTT). In light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this Decision and without prejudice to further investigation by the UOKiK, the relevant product market is the market for the wholesale supply of TV channels, including their ancillary services and covering all types of infrastructure. The questi on whether this product market can be further segmented (i) by genre, (ii) by distribution technology, or between (iii) FTA and pay TV channels, and in turn whether pay TV channels can be further segmented between basic pay and premium pay TV channels, or (iv) FTA and basic pay TV channels on the one hand, and premium pay TV channels on the other hand could be left open as it would not change the outcome of the Commission\u2019s evaluation of the Referral Request."

    "topic": "A2A CIS market segmentation based on scope of services provided",
    "text": "The results of the market investigation indicates that software -only solutions and managed services are likely to constitute distinct product markets for the following reasons.\nFirst, most competitors and a significant share of customers consider that A2A CIS providers do not typically have the capabilities to provide both software solutions and managed services. In particular, market participants stressed the fact that the \u201cbusiness model for [managed] services and [software] products is quite different\u201d and that providing managed services \u201cimplies much wider responsibilities and different type of expertise than just delivering a [software] product\u201d. The Commission notes that this contradicts the argument made by the Parties, according to which managed services are simply mechanisms by which the software solution may be delivered.\nMoreover, several market participants disputed the Parties\u2019 claim that, apart from the software, the components required to provide managed services are commodity products readily available on the market, indicating that some of these components are \u201cproprietary or complex components\u201d (such as core gateways), which are difficult to find on the market. In addition, a competitor stressed that \u201cselect[ing], specify[ing] and arrang[ing] these components to work effectively with the [software]\u201d is \u201cessential\u201d to be able to provide managed services and require specific \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nSecond, competitors generally consider that the provision of managed services and software -only solutions are characterized by different competitive dynamics and landscape. A large number of respondents to the market investigation explained that, although some A2A CIS providers (such as the Parties) offer both types of solutions, most players provide either only managed services or only software solutions. A competitor expressly indicated that \u201cin most cases, providers are specialized to offer only one type of solution\u201d. Similarly, a customer stated that A2A CIS provider \u201cnormally offer one or another kind of solutions, but not both\u201d. For example, STET indicated that it \u201conly offers the managed service but do not sell the products i.e. not the software\u201d. This is also reflected in the Parties\u2019 internal documents, which qualify two competitors, namely [\u2026] and [\u2026], as \u201csoftware vendor\u201d. The Parties do not contest the above and expressly acknowledged that a large number of A2A CIS providers do not offer both managed and software solutions which, in their view, \u201cmay be due to competitors\u2019 capabilities\u201d or to \u201ca deliberate strategic choice based on each competitor\u2019s preferred business model\u201d."

    "topic": "A2A CIS market segmentation based on type of payment processing",
    "text": "The results of the market investigation suggest that distinguishing instant and batch payment processing would not be warranted.\nFirst, the Commission found that instant payments are progressively replacing batch payments, but that the migration of the entire market may take a long time depending on the specificities of each country; for this reason, batch payments are expected to continue to exist for many years. As a result, both types of payment processing are currently coexisting in the EEA, where it is not uncommon to have A2A CIS tenders requiring solutions covering both batch and instant payments. The Parties provided several recent examples of such tenders (including e.g. in the Nordics (P27), the UK, Austria, Bulgaria and Slovenia). This is also corroborated by the feedback received from the market. For example, a competitor stated that \u201crequirements in A2A CIS tenders tend to encompass both batch and real -time solutions\u201d.\nSecond, a majority of competitors consider that the processing of batch and instant payment relies, to a large extent, on the same core technology. For example, a rival of the Parties indicated that \u201cthe approach to processing A2A instant payments and A2A batch payments follow very similar patterns\u201d. Although some market participants took the opposite view, they did not deny the existence of similarities between batch and instant payments, but gave a more nuanced picture stating that the \u201cunderlying technology could be different\u201d or that \u201cwhile the underlying processes can be very similar and the software deployed can also be very similar, there are significant differences on how the underlying systems behave\u201d.\nThird, most competitors and customers consider that A2A CIS providers typically have the capabilities to process both types of payment. A respondent explained that \u201ctraditionally A2A CIS players provided batch payment solutions but [\u2026] have developed instant payment solutions to respond to demand\u201d, which has evolved over time. Several respondent also stressed that A2A CIS providers, which do not have yet the capabilities to process instant payments, \u201cwill complete sooner or later the necessary steps to develop and implement A2A instant payment solutions\u201d.\nFinally, competitors generally took the view that the batch and instant payment processing should not be considered as separate markets as they present similar competitive dynamics and landscape."

Within parasiticides, the Commission found that products targeting multi -celled parasites ( e.g. fleas and worms) and products targeting single -celled parasites (\u201canticoccidials\u201d) constitute distinct product market s. As regards multi -celled parasiticides, the Commission distinguished three categories . (i) ectoparasiticides (or ecto products), used to control external parasites ( e.g. fleas, ticks), (ii) endoparasiticides (or endo products), used to control internal parasites ( e.g. flukes, tapeworms, roundworms ), and (iii) endectocides (or endecto products), used to control both external and internal parasites. Given the existence of a certain degree of substitutability, the Commission also envisaged alternative mark et segments comprising (i) ecto/endecto products together and (ii) endo/endecto products together, but ultimately left the market definition open."

    "text": "The investigation confirmed that there is limited substitutability between foam and mineral fibre sandwich panels, mainly due to their different product characteristics (notably the largely diverging fire resistance, thermal and acoustic insulation properties and price) . The investigation suggests that within foam and mineral fibre sandwich panels there is significant differentiation amongst other factors for example between different thicknesses of the sandwich panels.\n\nThe majority of market participants indicated that foam sandwich panels and mineral fibre sandwich panels are substitutable only to a limited extent from a demand- side viewpoint. For various applications , either foam or mineral fibre sandwich panels could be used. In many cases there are however specific applications, for which one is particularly more appropriate than the other. \u201c Rockwool panels are usually used where specific fire or acoustic performance is required as they outperform foam. Foam is generally cheaper, lighter and easier to install as they perform better thermally at like for like thicknesses and the foam is significantly lighter.\u201d Respondents confirmed that for certain applications mineral fibre sandwich panels are more suitable than foam sandwich panels , including notably for \u201cprojects requiring panels with a fire resistance of more than 30 minutes \u201d. For other applications, particularly when high thermal performance is required (e.g. cold storage) and for buildings with higher humidity foam sandwich panels are more suitable than mineral fibre sandwich panels . Therefore, the investigation confirmed limited demand -side substitutability between foam and mineral sandwich panels .\n\nA predominant number of respondents produce mineral fibre sandwich panels and foam sandwich panels on distinct production lines. The majority of the competitors that expressed their opinion and who currently do not produce both products on the same line would rather not consider manufacturing foam and mineral fibre sandwich panels on the same production line for productivity and logistics reasons . According to some respondents, switching production between mineral fibre and foam core on the same line can take \u201cabout 6 hours \u201d or \u201c1/2 shift  [\u2026] depending on age of technology \u201d. Other respondents indicated that switching production takes less time. Therefore, the investigation suggest s that substitution from the supply -side may be limited.\n\nIn light of the above, based on the results of the market investigation carried out in the present case, the Commission considers that mineral fibre sandwich panels and foam sandwich panels belong to separate product markets."

According to the majority of customers that expressed their opinion, refrigerating panels are distinct products from standard foam panels since they fulfil different needs. The most significant differences are according to both customers and competitors the thermal insulation performance, the price per square meter , and the panel thickness, followed by the joint geometry and other joint features, the foam composition and specialised sales channels.\n\nThe overwhelming majorit y of competitors manufactures both standard foam sandwich panels and refrigerating foam sandwich panels on the same production line. According to a competitor \u201c for efficiency reasons, it is better to have one dedicated line for each product group\u201d. However, t he investigation showed that all competitors that are based in the CEE region (where the Target is active), and which produce both standard and refrigerating foam sandwich panels, produce both types on the same production line. The respondents indic ated that switching production between standard and refrigerating sandwich panels requires only between 30 minutes and 2 hours, if the line is able to produce both type of foam sandwiches.\n\nTherefore, the investigation suggests that at least in the CEE r egion there is ample supply -side substitution between standard and refrigerating foam sandwich panels. For purposes of this D ecision, foam sandwich panels, including standard and refrigerating foam sandwich panels , constitute one product market."

The Notifying Party claims that the exact definition of the geographic scope of the market can be left open, although it considers the relevant market to be national in scope because customers can increasingly search for OE spare parts online across Germany and have them installed by independent repair shops. When zooming into the local level, the Notifying Party considers the metropolitan area of Hamburg to be the narrowest plausible geographic scope of the market for the purpose of this case. Customers that source OE spare parts together with car repair and maintenance services are typically willing to drive a certain distance (50 -100 km) in order to get these services at a lower price. The Commission considers that, in any case, the scope of the geographic market can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts whether the geographic market is considered national or sub-national (i.e. in this case the metropolitan area of Hamburg) in scope."

The Notifying Parties argue that a segmentation is not necessary as, from the perspective of customers, the individual procedural steps are not relevant for the selection of a recycling service provider. While the type and amount of materials that can be reclaimed through SRC s recycling can vary, a further segmentation on the basis of recovered materials is not necessary . What and how much can be reclaimed impacts the commercial conditions under which the recycling service is provided, but the recycling process will remain the same. The Notifying Parties also consider that there are no differences between the recycling of different types of SRC s.

As regards the different stages of recycling, replies to the Commission\u2019s market investigation showed that recyclers are integrated to different extents. In respect of collection, according to the Notifying Parties, transportation of the SRC s is typically a responsibility of the refineries (although there can be specific instances where a recycler may agree with a refiner to take responsibility over the logistics). This seems to be supported by the market investigation. In any event, transportation is carried out by a (speciali sed) freight handler for the physical transportation of the SRC to the facilities of the SRC recycling services provider , since refineries (or recyclers) generally do not own special ised bins or rail cars for such transportation. As regards the stages of roasting, melting and by -product extraction, whilst the major competitors active in the recycling of SRC s are active across the value chain, there are some market participants who only offer roasting.

The Commission ultimately left open the question of the existence of a distinct product market for each of cells and modules separately.\nThe Commission has also previously indicated that for automotive batteries, a distinction could be drawn between Li -ion and NiMH batteries. This possible distinction was however also left open.\nThe Notifying Parties argue that since the Commission last examined this market over ten years ago, technology has evolved and almost all cells and modules manufacturers for the automotive industry now use Li -ion technology.

Post -Transaction there will remain many alternative providers of OTT services in Sweden and Finland, including offerings from NENT, Netfli x and HBO Nordic in Sweden and Elisa, DNA, Netflix, NENT and HBO in Finland. The acquisition of standalone OTT rights by Discovery will make it better positioned to be able to compete with these rival suppliers."

The licensing of standalone OTT rights to Discovery in Sweden and Finland is consistent with the counterfactual scenario that the Commissio n has outlined in the Decision, in which Bonnier Broadcasting would have licensed standalone OTT rights to one other purchaser in each Sweden and Finland. Discovery has its own OTT channels as well as the relevant experience and incentive to become a signi ficant aggregator of TV channels and TV content over the internet. The acquisition of the standalone OTT rights by Discovery will ensure that an additional player will be able to compete with the Combined Group in the provision of OTT channel aggregation s ervices, as would have likely been the case absent the Transaction."

    "text": "Natura submits that the exact geographic market definition for the various overlapping product categories can be left open in the present case but acknowledged the Commission\u2019s prior practice and provided market data at national level. The outcome of the market investigation has confirmed that the relevant geographic market for each relevant product category is national in scope. In particular, though some comments pointed to a possible convergence in consumer preferences and a blurring of distribution patterns due to e-commerce, a clear majority of competitors and of wholesalers still consider that the relevant geographic market should be defined at national level. As a large competitor indicated: \u201c[our] market position differs from country to country and there are differences in brands\u2019 strengths and positioning across countries. Consumers\u2019 preferences in terms of products and brands are also different across the European countries, and the formats of the products may vary. Also, product penetration and development varies per country \u201d. In conclusion, based on the information submitted by Natura and the results of the market investigation, all relevant markets described in section 4.2. will be assessed at national level. In any event, the precise geographic market definition can be left open since the Transaction does not give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement under any plausible geographic market definitions, whether comprising the whole of the EEA, possible country clusters or Member States and Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement."

However, the majority of respondents to the market investigation indicated that other ports in mainland Great Britain such as Bristol, Clydeport (Glasgow and surroundings), Manchester, Newport or Cardiff would not be an alternative to the port of Liverpool, because these ports would either not have the facilities for larger containerships or because they lack the required hinterland connections.\n\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the exact geographic scope of the market for container terminal services for hinterland traffic can be left open, as no serious doubts would arise as to the Transaction\u2019s compatibility with the internal market also under the narrower plausible geographic market definition comprising only the four ports of Southampton, Felixstowe, London Gateway and Liverpool."

In past cases, the Commission looked separately at the plausible narrower markets for reefer containers and non -refrigerated (warm) containers only when the share of the reefer containers in relation to all containerised cargo was 10% or more on both legs of trade. In the present Transaction, this is the case for three trades on which MSC is providing deep -sea container liner shipping services, namely the Northern Europe \u2013 Australia/New Zealand, the Northern Europe \u2013 West Africa and the Northern Europe \u2013 Caribbean & Central America trade.\n\nWhile the Notifying Parties do not dispute the above mentioned market definition, they argue that a reefer market would not be relevant for the purpose of assessing the Transaction. The Notifying Parties have nonetheless provided the Commission with the information necessary to assess the effects of the Transaction.\n\nThe Commission notes that the volume of reefer cargo shipped to and from the port of Liverpool on the legs of trade of the three trades mentioned above is basically non-existent and amounts to at most 0.007% of the overall reefer cargo volume on each leg of trade. This Decision assesses the competitive effects of the acquisition of joint control over the L2 Terminal in the port of Liverpool. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing the vertical link between container terminal services and deep -sea container shipping services created by the Transaction, the Commission considers it not meaningful to assess a narrower market segment for reefer containers only.\n\nThe Commission will therefore, for the purpose of this Decision, assess only the overall market for deep -sea container liner shipping services."

The Commission considered in its prior decisional practice in short -sea container liner shipping, in trades with a share of reefer containers in relation to all containerized cargo below 10% in both directions, transport in reefer containers is not assessed separately, but as part of the overall market for container liner shipping services.\n\nThe Notifying Parties do not dispute the above mentioned market definition and submit that the precise market definition can be left open.

    "topic": "Flame Retardants",
    "text": "Flame retardants are chemicals incorporated into a variety of manufactured materials to increase their resistance to ignition, or by acting to slow down combustion. The Notifying Party submits that flame retardants should be sub-segmented according to the chemistry used, for example: (i) brominated; (ii) chlorinated; (iii) aluminium tri-hydroxide based; and (iv) phosphorus based. It argues that it would not be appropriate to sub-segment the market further based on end application, for example for use in: (i) PVC; (ii) polyamides; or (iii) polyurethane (\"PU\"); because the same type of flame retardants can be used for different applications and different types of flame retardants can be used for the same application. The Commission has previously noted that flame retardants can differ depending on the chemistry used or on the basis of the application but that manufacturers of flame retardants can use different inputs to achieve flame retardants with comparable characteristics. The Commission found that the market could potentially be sub-segmented by type but it ultimately left the market definition open, undertaking the assessment based on the market broken down by chemistry and end application. The market investigation was inconclusive as to whether it would be appropriate to further segment the market according to chemistry used. The vast majority of respondents consider that flame retardants based on different chemistries can be used for the same end applications in some cases, but not all. In turn, the market investigation was also inconclusive as to whether it could be appropriate to sub-segment either phosphorus or bromine based flame retardants according to end use. The vast majority of respondents consider that products based on a particular chemistry are partially interchangeable in that they can be used for some end-applications, but not all. In particular, a slight majority consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PVC applications and the majority of respondents consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PU applications. A horizontally affected market arises in relation to bromine based flame retardants and a few market participants raised concerns regarding phosphorus based flame retardants which are therefore considered below in the competitive assessment. For the purpose of the present decision, the exact scope of the product market definition for flame retardants and its sub-segments therein can be left open, since no serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market arise, regardless of whether the market is considered to be broken down by chemistry or further broken down by end application."

Chemtura uses TMP for the production of: (i) resins; (ii) PU-hardeners; and (iii) lubricant products; although it also has other uses. The Commission has previously considered whether TMP is part of an overall market for polyhydric alcohols or forms a separate product market but has left the product market definition open. It has never considered further segmenting the market for TMP. The Notifying Party considers that TMP is substitutable with other polyhydric alcohols therefore that the relevant market should be defined as including all polyhydric alcohols. Moreover, the Notifying Party submits that it supplies one grade of TMP for all applications. A vertically affected market arises in relation to the supply of TMP therefore this market which is therefore considered below in the competitive assessment. For the purpose of the present decision, the exact scope of the product market definition for the supply of TMP can be left open, since no serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market arise even under the narrowest possible market definition (that is TMP)."

BAE has a limited direct presence in the supply of PGM s, where it is mainly active indirectly through its shareholding in MBDA held by BAE's UK parent . On bala nce, BAE appears unlikely to have the ability or the incentive to foreclose upstream or downstream competitors . This is notably because , as the Commission understands, the GPS Business is reliant on authorisations of the DoD to produce and sell GPS receive rs and the DoD is an important cust omer of the GPS Business itself . In addition, DoD\u2019s authorisations require maintaining a strict separation between BAE\u2019s US entity (BAE Systems, Inc.) that will acquire the GPS Business, and BAE\u2019s UK parent , which holds t he interest in MBDA. In particular, i mplementing foreclosure measures would involve sharing sensitive information between BAE\u2019s US entity and MBDA , which would be in breach of the firewall required by the DoD authorisations."

Notably, it has been argued that the heart of an MCU is its computational core, which in itself differs from each other based on the data width it can handle at one time.

Therefore, the Commission envisaged to segment the market based on the type of risk covered, distinguishing notably the following segments: (i) motor vehicle,  (ii) property, (iii) credit and suretyship, (iv) liability, (v) accident and sickness, (vi) marine, aviation and transport ( \u201cMAT \u201d), and (vii) and travel insurance .

As explained in Section 5. 2.1, Evraz \u2013 due to the ongoing business rescue and liquidation processes - is no longer able t o exercise decisive influence over Highveld or the Mapochs Mine and is highly unlikely to regain control over them in the future , which means that the horizontal and vertical non -coordinated anti-competitive effects linked to the merger are no longer likely to arise . In this regard the Commission notes that the fact that the acquisition of the Mapochs Mine by IRL is not yet implemented has no effect on Evraz \u2019 loss of control as the latter occurred as a consequence of the business rescue/liquidation processes."

    "text": "The majority of respondents to the Commission\u2019s market investigation confirmed that VP Latex should be considered a separate product market from other synthetic latexes. Customers generally did not consider that VP Latex could be substituted with other latexes, with some noting that other latex products do not have the same adhesion qualities as VP Latex . Even some of those customers that thought switching between VP Latex and other latex products might be possible highlighted that switching between them wo uld require a material and time -consuming change in the formulation that customers use to manufacture the end -products. Competitors\u2019 responses were inconclusive as to the degree of supply -side substitution between VP Latex and other synthetic latex produc ts.\nWhile the market investigation did not provide evidence that a segmentation by application was necessary , it nonetheless revealed that customers typically purchase a specific grade of VP Latex to be incorporated in the finished products they manufactu re. Most customers that responded to the market investigation considered that switching between grades of VP Latex was challenging. In particular, customers noted that switching would require a change in the formulation used, may impact the adhesion performance of the end product, and would require testing and approvals by end -customer s.\nOn the other hand, the market investigation clearly confirmed that there is supply -side substitution between VP Latex grades. All suppliers that responded indicated that they can and do switch production between VP Latex with high and low vinyl pyridine content on the same production line with limited effort.\nFor the reasons set out above, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this decision, VP Latex co nstitutes a distinct product market from other synthetic latex products , without the need for further segmentation."

    "text": "The results of the market investigation did not confirm the view of the Notifying Party, but rather point ed to the existence of an EEA -wide market for VP Latex.\nWhile the Parties may export VP Latex outside the EEA, their sales into the EEA are very limited . Moreover, imports of VP Latex in the EEA are limited. Very few EEA end -customers responding to the market investigation indicated that they source VP Latex from suppliers outside the EEA, in line with the Notifying Party\u2019s estimate that imports account for a small proportion of sales in the EEA ( around or less than 10% in 2018 , see Table 1 below). Moreover, those respondents who do procure VP Latex from outside the EEA confirmed that they do not rely on non -EEA suppliers as their primary supplier, procuring only a small part of their needs from them (typically 10 -15%).\nSecond , the majority of EEA end -customers indicated that it was important for their supplier\u2019s factory to be close to their production plants to manage costs, lead time and business continuity. This is supported by the fact that respondents typically require just -in-time delivery or hold stock to cover their short -term needs.\nThird , a clear majority of EEA end -customers indicated that there were barriers to procuring VP Latex from other regions, in particular long delivery periods, sizeable transport costs, concerns around ensuring the security of supply, as well as the risk that the product may be damaged in transit. Suppliers responding to the market investigation agreed and identified similar barriers. In particular, transport costs were identified as a key barrier to shipping across regions.\nFourth , customers were generall y sceptical or unsure about the credibility of Asian suppliers as an alternative in the EEA, with a number of customers raising substantial concerns around security of supply, lead time, transport costs and quality.\nFinally , there is no strong evidence th at a hypothetical small but significant and non -transitory increase in price in the EEA would be unprofitable due to the constraint from suppliers outside Europe. EEA end -customers responding to the market investigation were split on whether they would con sider importing from outside the EEA in the event of such an increase. In practice, for the reasons set out in the previous recitals, only limited switching seems likely. Moreover, certain suppliers who responded noted that a hypothetical 5 -10% increase i n price in the EEA may not be sufficient to offset the high cost of transporting VP Latex from Asia to Europe.\nIn light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the case at hand, the relevant geographic market for VP Latex is EEA -wide. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that the assessment of the Transaction would not change even if the relevant geographic market were considered to be worldwide ."

Some customers explained that they are price sensitive, so they might instead turn to suppliers in China, Japan, India, Russia, Brazil or the US.\nHowever, other aspects of the market investigation pointed towards a narrower, EEA -wide relevant geographic market.\nFirst, most XNBR customers that responded to the market investigation consider it important to be supplied by a production plant close to their plants, because transportation costs, lead -time, security of supply and the shelf -life of XNBR (estimated by customers to be 6 months) typically dictate where they procure from .\nSecond, m ost customers indicated that there are barriers to procuring XNBR across regions. T ransport costs, long delivery periods, import/export tariffs and security of supply were mentioned among such barriers .

Furthermore, detailed catchment area data reveals that significant amounts of asphalt are sold externally.

It argues that it would not be appropriate to sub-segment the market further based on end application, for example for use in: (i) PVC; (ii) polyamides; or (iii) polyurethane (\"PU\"); because the same type of flame retardants can be used for different applications and different types of flame retardants can be used for the same application. The Commission has previously noted that flame retardants can differ depending on the chemistry used or on the basis of the application but that manufacturers of flame retardants can use different inputs to achieve flame retardants with comparable characteristics. The Commission found that the market could potentially be sub-segmented by type but it ultimately left the market definition open, undertaking the assessment based on the market broken down by chemistry and end application. The market investigation was inconclusive as to whether it would be appropriate to further segment the market according to chemistry used. The vast majority of respondents consider that flame retardants based on different chemistries can be used for the same end applications in some cases, but not all. In turn, the market investigation was also inconclusive as to whether it could be appropriate to sub-segment either phosphorus or bromine based flame retardants according to end use. The vast majority of respondents consider that products based on a particular chemistry are partially interchangeable in that they can be used for some end-applications, but not all. In particular, a slight majority consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PVC applications and the majority of respondents consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PU applications. A horizontally affected market arises in relation to bromine based flame retardants and a few market participants raised concerns regarding phosphorus based flame retardants which are therefore considered below in the competitive assessment. For the purpose of the present decision, the exact scope of the product market definition for flame retardants and its sub-segments therein can be left open, since no serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market arise, regardless of whether the market is considered to be broken down by chemistry or further broken down by end application."

T he Parties also submit that supply of hospitality services to MNOs, FWA suppliers and other categories of telecommunications operators ( in particular, IoT, but also OTMOs to the extent they are not MNOs or FWA suppliers) should be part of the overall market, but in any case the question could be left open, as the Transaction would not raise any competitive concern in that respect.\n The Commission has previously identified a market for sites and site infrastructure for digital mobile radio -telecommunications equipment. The Commission concluded that the possibility for operators of TV and radio broadcasting sites to satisfy the needs of MNOs were limited . Indeed, a lthough there was a tendency for MNOs to utilise broadcast ing structures where they are suitable for the local requirem ents of the service, generally broadcast ing transmission equipment is located on sites affording a much higher level of geographical coverage when compared to the coverage requirements of mobile systems. Consequently, broadcast ing sites tend to be tall str uctures in elevated locations that transmit at high powers in order to achieve optimal population coverage using a limited number of sites. In view of capacity considerations, mobile radio networks are cellular in nature, each site providing sufficient but limited coverage, reducing inter -cell interference and allowing the frequency allocations to be re -used in other areas.\n The vast majority of the participants to the market investigation confirmed that suppliers of mobile telecommunications services and suppliers of TV/Radio broadcasting services have different requirements for hospitality services. Generally, towers originally designed to serve MNOs would be limited in their ability to offer hospitality services to radio and TV broadcasters. Moreover, T V and radio broadcasters need higher transmission power and need to be located outside of densely populated areas, while MNOs would require capillary distribution of antennas especially in densely populated areas."

    "text": "With respect to micro -sites, the vast majority of respondents to the market investigation submitted that MNO s using hospitality services on macro -sites would consider hospitality services on micro- sites as a complement and not as an alternative for their network. Micro- cells are used in combination with macro cells to improve coverage and capacity in very densely occupied areas (stadium, shopping malls ) or to reach areas where normal infrastructure is insufficient (underground, high buildings). In other terms, while macro -sites are deployed to achieve homogeneous coverage, small cells deployment is instead used to address specific capacity need s within a limited area, often a public venue (outdoor or indoor) or a particularly crowded area. Due to the limited coverage range of a small cell, it will be not feasible, both technically and economically, to plan an extensive coverage only leveraging s mall cells, since a very high number of small cell sites would be needed to achieve the minimum coverage objective. From a structural point of view, micro -sites would not be suitable to host antenna equi pment usually deployed on macro -sites, as antennas hosted on macro- sites are larger and require higher locations. Furthermore, those antennas are characterized by higher output power (and thus electromagnetic emissions) and therefore they cannot be placed on typical micro -cells locations, since these latter are generally at human height."

The Commission noted that medicines may be subdivided into therapeutic classes by reference to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (\u201cATC\u201d ), devised by the European Pharmaceutical Marketing Research Association (\u201cEphMRA\u201d) and maintained by EphMRA and IQVIA, formerly known as Intercontinental Medical Statistics (\u201cIMS\u201d). The ATC system is a hierarchical and coded four -level system which classifies medicinal products by class according to their indication, therapeutic use, composition, and mode of action. In the first and broadest level (ATC 1), medicinal products are divided into the 16 anatomical main groups. The second level (ATC 2) is either a pharmacological or therapeutic group. The third level (ATC 3) further groups medicinal products by their specific therapeutic indications. Finally, the ATC 4 level is generally the most detailed one (not available for all ATC 3) and refers for instance to the mode of action or any other subdivision of the relevant products."

In particular, in relation to originator and generic medicines, the Commission has considered in previous decisions plausible product markets at the ATC 4 level, at a level of a molecule or a group of molecules that are considered interchangeable so as to exercise competitive pressure on one another. However, an overlap in therapeutic uses does not necessarily imply any particular economic substitution patterns between products."

    "topic": "Clutch Actuation",
    "text": "The Notifying Party submits that in a first step, the relevant product markets should be segmented along the lines of dif ferent transmission systems, as clutch actuation using CPCAs, PCAs and ECAs is relevant only for AMT but not for manual transmission (\u201cMT\u201d), automatic transmission (\u201cAT\u201d) or electric transmissions. Furthermore, the Notifying Party contends that, whereas the same functionality of different clutch actuators speaks in favour of a product market comprising all three kinds of clutch actuators, it is more appropriate to further sub -segment the relevant product market by differentiating between CPCAs , PCAs and EC As. The Notifying Party substantiates its view by pointing to the technical differences and price differences between CP CAs, PCAs and ECAs . Furthermore, according to the Notifying Party, CPCAs and PCA are not interchangeable for use in the same type of A MT. With regard to the differentiation between OEM/OES markets on the one hand and IAM markets on the other hand, the Notifying Party explains that the OEM/OES sales channel accounts for the vast majority of the sales. Since clutch actuators are not wear and tear parts (in other words, they do not need regular replacement but should last for the lifetime of the MHCV), i f, exceptionally, a CPCA requires replacement, it is typically replaced by a product of the original CPCA supplier. There are typical ly no third party products that could be used instead of the original parts.\n\nThe Commission takes note of the fact that PCAs are the older technology compared to CPCAs and that PCA -technology is being phased- out from the market. This is supported by the N otifying Party\u2019 s submission of information with respect to EEA -wide and worldwide tenders for clutch actuators, according to which all but one next generation transmission systems of the relevant OEMs will utilise CPCA technology (or ECA technology, as the case may be), which replaces the currently commonly utilised PCA technology.\n\nGiven the differences between the three technologies and the fact that tenders specifically request a PCA, a CPCA, or an ECA, none of the technologies appears directly substitutable for another. For the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the market for clutch actuators can therefore be further subdivided into three separate product markets: (i) CPCAs for AMTs ; (ii) PCAs for AMTs; and (iii ) ECAs for AMTs."

Transportation costs are low, given the compact size of CPCA.\n\nFor AMT gearboxes and AMT controllers, the vast majority of the respondents which expressed an opinion, considered that the relevant geographic market is either EEA -wide or global. As CPCAs are a component designed exclusively for AMT gearboxes, the same market dynamics appear to apply to CPCAs. In any event, nothing in the Commission \u2019s market investigation suggests otherwise.\n\nFor the purpose of this D ecision, it can be left open whether the geographic market for CPCAs is EEA -wide or global , as the outcome of the competitive assessment would be t he same under either geographic market definition."

For example, OEMs seems to have an advantage in major correctives, remote monitoring, and, more generally, in being able to provide a more comprehensive service. They also have an advantage in newer turbine types as in respect of these turbines the knowledge is less widespread and they are more protected by IP than older turbines. By contrast, ISPs are smaller, more agile, have lower costs and thus they are more competitive in scheduled maintenance and minor correctives.

However, the Commission has left open whether the battery market should be segmented according to sales channel. The term 'industrial channel' as used in the Panasonic/Sanyo precedent is largely synonymous with 'OEM channel ': \"The industrial channel would consist of sales to device manufactures and pack makers (including private label suppliers) while the consumer channel according to the Parties consists of direct sales to wholesalers and retailers \".\nThe Notifying Party submits that there is a distinction between the wholesale supply of consumer batteries by specialized manufacturers to the OEM channel and the wholesale supply of consumer batteries by battery manufacturers to retailers and wholesalers, which is the level of trade where the Parties mainly overlap. \nThe Notifying Party cites the arguments made by the Parties in Panasonic/Sanyo , which were as follows. First, the batteries that are sold to these two channels are different, as the batteries for the industrial channel are enhanced so they are more reliable and have longer shelf life. Second, the batteries for the customer channel are standardized as opposed to the OEM channel, where the customers can have the products tailored to their own specifications. Third, consumer branding is significantly more important at the consumer level as opposed to the OEM level. Fourth, the contractual terms for the customers in these two channels are also different. Fifth, the price levels in these two channels are different."

    "text": "In addition, the respective modes of action of mesalazine and biologics are quite different . Mesalazine is a type of amino salicylate containing 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). It works by reducing inflammation on the wall of the intestine and as such has a predominantly topical action. Mesalazine is generally very well tolerated as it acts locally and has low toxicity. Different classes of biologic treatment have different modes of action but they have in common the fact that they target the cause of the inflammation, e.g. by suppressing the immune response directly or blocking the pathways that would usually lead to an immune response. Biologics therefore address the disease in a more fundamental way than mesalazine , which simply treats the symptoms topically ."

The Notifying Party submits that flame retardants should be sub-segmented according to the chemistry used, for example: (i) brominated; (ii) chlorinated; (iii) aluminium tri-hydroxide based; and (iv) phosphorus based. It argues that it would not be appropriate to sub-segment the market further based on end application, for example for use in: (i) PVC; (ii) polyamides; or (iii) polyurethane (\"PU\"); because the same type of flame retardants can be used for different applications and different types of flame retardants can be used for the same application. The Commission has previously noted that flame retardants can differ depending on the chemistry used or on the basis of the application but that manufacturers of flame retardants can use different inputs to achieve flame retardants with comparable characteristics. The Commission found that the market could potentially be sub-segmented by type but it ultimately left the market definition open, undertaking the assessment based on the market broken down by chemistry and end application. The market investigation was inconclusive as to whether it would be appropriate to further segment the market according to chemistry used. The vast majority of respondents consider that flame retardants based on different chemistries can be used for the same end applications in some cases, but not all. In turn, the market investigation was also inconclusive as to whether it could be appropriate to sub-segment either phosphorus or bromine based flame retardants according to end use. The vast majority of respondents consider that products based on a particular chemistry are partially interchangeable in that they can be used for some end-applications, but not all. In particular, a slight majority consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PVC applications and the majority of respondents consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PU applications. A horizontally affected market arises in relation to bromine based flame retardants and a few market participants raised concerns regarding phosphorus based flame retardants which are therefore considered below in the competitive assessment. For the purpose of the present decision, the exact scope of the product market definition for flame retardants and its sub-segments therein can be left open, since no serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market arise, regardless of whether the market is considered to be broken down by chemistry or further broken down by end application."

The Commission found that most of the coal and iron ore handled by the terminals in the Antwerp -Rotterdam -Amsterdam, (\"ARA \") range goes to hinterland customers. However, a limited volume of coal and iron ore handled in these ports is transhipped by coasters to another final discharge port . In many instances this final discharge port is a draught restricted port in the United Kingdom. Although the main handling techniques and the handling terms and conditions are similar, whether the coal or iron ore is transported to the hinterland or tran shipped, the range of ports and terminals that may be potential substitutes for transhipment traffic is not identical to the range of ports and terminals that may be substitutes for specific hinterland traffic.

    "text": "The Parties submit that the generation and wholesale supply of electricity constitutes one single relevant product market that: (i) has not and should not be segmented on the basis of the source of electricity generation (e.g., renewable sources); but (ii) should encompass electricity imports and physical and financial trading on organised markets (e.g., Belpex) and OTC. The Commission has consistently defined a relevant product market encompassing both the generation and wholesale supply of electricity, irrespective of the generation sources and trading channels. The Commission has also considered in the past whether the financial trading of electricity belonged to the same product market as the generation and wholesale supply of electricity, or to distinct markets. Generally, financial trading has been distinguished from wholesale supply due to differences in settlement, duration and overall function since financially settled contracts are about trading risk while physically traded ones are about trading electricity for consumption. However, in EDG/Segebel , the Commission concluded in relation to Belgium that the relevant market comprised electricity generation, imports and trading on organised markets or OTC for both physically and financially settled products. In the present case, the distinction between physically and financially settled trades can be left open since the Proposed Transaction is unlikely to raise serious doubts on a narrow definition limited to physically traded electricity. Regarding a possible segmentation according to the source of electricity, the question arises whether a dynamic assessment ought not to take into account Belgium's commitment to exit nuclear electricity production. However, that commitment will in any event not materialise before 2025 and implementing measures still need to be adopted and may then be adjusted to ensure security of supply or reflect energy cost developments. Moreover, nuclear plants still account for 56% of total electricity production in Belgium. Hence, a segmentation according to generation source, and in particular excluding nuclear, does not appear to be a plausible option in the present context. Overall, the precise market definition can be left open since no serious doubts arise as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market, even on the narrowest plausible segmentation, which in the context of this case is the generation and wholesale physical supply of electricity irrespective of the source."

In any event, the Parties consider that no competitive concerns would arise if one were to consider only a hypothetical Belgian market, and provided data accordingly. The Commission has indeed historically defined the market for the generation and wholesale supply of electricity at national level. However, the Commission has also recognised the relevance of interconnection capacity between Member States and of pricing relationships across interconnection points. In the present case, the Parties have not submitted evidence supporting their claim that the market should be considered wider than Belgium, except for some high -level references to new interconnection projects.

The results of the market investigation confirmed the relevance of such a distinction. First, from a demand-side perspective, the respective CDMO services for API and FDP address separate needs. On the one hand, CDMO services at the API level involve the evaluation, characterisation, development of production and scaling-up processes in relation to the manufacture of API. On the other hand, CDMO services at the FDP level mainly pertain to the development of an appropriate dosage formulation and the large-scale manufacture of the final drug products. Second, from a supply-side perspective, CDMO services at the API and FDP levels do not involve the same equipment and require specific know-how and expertise. In fact, multiple CDMO players do not have the capability to be active throughout the CDMO value chain and several respondents to the market investigation indicated to be exclusively active either at the API level or at the FDP level."

In fact, competitors overall confirmed that they produce all typical concentration levels and purity levels of H2O2 and that their product portfolio covers the complete range of typical end -use applications. An exception to this was ultra-high concentrations (above 90%) for use in rocket propulsion purposes, for which none of the competitors confirmed its presence and for which some explicitly stated that their portfolio \u201cdoes not include super high concentrations such as 90-99%\u201d. In addition, in the EEA, none of the Parties has generated any sales relating to that specific end -use application .

According to the Notifying Party, this has stimulated intra-EEA trade and removed regulatory barriers. The Notifying Party concludes that since the Parties each sell their PAA cross -border throughout the EAA, from one production plant in Austria (Evonik) and Spain (PeroxyChem), and as there are common standards for transportation of PAA, the geographic market is EEA-wide in scope.\nCustomer replies to the Commission\u2019s market investigation confirmed that PAA is transported within the EEA rather easily. The Commission also observes that Evonik supplies the market from its single plant in Austria to distances of more than 1 500 to 2 000 kilometers.\nSimilarly, the Parties\u2019 competitors indicated that transport distances do not constitute a barrier to commercial opportunities vis -\u00e0-vis potential PAA customers around the EEA, irrespective of the precise location of their PAA manufacturing plants.\n"

For example, a separate market for private acute general hospitals was defined for the UK because on the UK market the demand for such services was different from the demand for public acute general hospitals."

Price levels of economy and \"premium\" (that is to say business and first class) seats were found to be significantly different. Also the sophistication of the seats and the skill required to produce premium seats was reported to be significantly higher such that a large number of suppliers was found to be active in economy seats only. The production volumes and also the production processes were also mentioned to differ, premium class seats requiring more manual labour while economy seat production was more automatized. Furthermore, certification was reported to be more challenging and to take longer for business class seats as opposed to economy. No such specific differentiators were mentioned between aircraft seats for first class and business class, as part of the premium segment. It was noted in addition that the boundary between business and first class seats was blurring and the number of first class seats decreasing as a result of business class products undergoing significant development and upgrade. For the reasons above, it is conceivable that a separate product market for business class seating could exist."

The Commission has therefore considered in this case a further split of the potential product market for narrow-body aircraft into (i) a segment for narrow-body aircraft with 90-120 seats and (ii) a segment for narrow-body aircraft with 120-200 seats. In any event, the sub-segmentation of the product market for commercial aircraft can be left open in this case as no serious doubts arise under either of the alternative market definitions."

    "topic": "Finished dose pharmaceutical products",
    "text": "When defining relevant markets in past decisions dealing with finished dose pharmaceutical products, the Commission based its assessment on the following general approach.\nThe Commission noted that medicines may be subdivided into therapeutic classes by reference to the \"Anatomical Therapeutic Classification\" (ATC), devised by the European Pharmaceutical Marketing Research Association (EphMRA) and maintained by E phMRA and Intercontinental Medical Statistics (IMS).\nThe ATC system is a hierarchical and coded four -level system which classifies medicinal products by class according to their indication, therapeutic use, composition , and mode of action. In the first and  broadest level (ATC  1), medicinal products are divided into the 16 anatomical main groups. The second level (ATC  2) is either a pharmacological or therapeutic group. The third level (ATC  3) further groups medicinal products by their specific therapeutic indications. Finally, the ATC4 level is the most detailed one (not available for all ATC  3) and refers for instance to the mode of action (e.g. distinction of some ATC  3 classes into topical and systemic depending on their way of action) or any other subdiv ision of the group. Medicinal products are classified according to the ATC system in the IMS Midas data base.\nThe Commission has referred to the third level (ATC  3) as the starting point for defining the relevant product market. However, in a number of cases, the Commission found that the ATC  3 level classification did not yield the appropriate market definition within the meaning of the Commission Notice on the Definition of the Relevant Market. In particular in relation to originator and generic medi cines, the Commission has considered in previous decision plausible product markets at the ATC4 level, at a level of a molecule or a group of molecules that are considered interchangeable so as to exercise competitive pressure on one another. However, it s hould be borne in mind that the overlap in therapeutic uses does not necessarily imply any particular economic substitution patterns between products.\nIn relation to generic medicines  sold on prescription (\"Rx\") , the Commission has also considered in previous decisions that the most plausible product market is generally at the level of a molecule  since generics are the closest substitutes to the originator product based on the same molecule . The Commission then assesses the potential for these products to enter into competition with other products by reference to their characteristics, intended therapeutic use, and expected therapeutic and economic substitutability.\nIn relation to OTC products sold in pharmacies , the active ingredient  (molecule)   appears to play a much more subordinated role, unless it is equivalent to a specific therapeutic/labelled indication  (in situations where all products based on the same molecule and only those, have the same indication) . The Commission has con sidered in previous decisions that the most plausible product market is generally at the level of the therapeutic indication, which may be a sub -division of the ATC  3 or even ATC  4 categories or may combine products belonging to different ATC  3 or ATC  4 categories. In view of these specificities, IMS has developed a specific classification for OTC products, based on OTC 2 and OTC 3 levels. In previous  decisions  dealing with OTC products , the Commission has also referred to the OTC  3 level as the starting  point for defining the relevant product market in OTC markets ."

Medical indications, side effects, regulatory framework, distribution and marketing tend to differ between these drug categories, ev en if the active ingredients may sometimes be identical.\nOTC products may be advertised to the public , as a result of which brands play a comparatively more significant role in the OTC industry, and advertising is a key feature in these markets . In additi on, p rescribers do not need to intervene in the purchase of OTC  products. In most cases, c onsumers choose OTC pharmaceuticals themselves, possibly following the guidance of a pharmacist, and purchases are generally not reimbursed. In making purchasing deci sions, consumers seem to predominately rely, aside from the brand, on therapeutic/labelled indication and price.\nBy contrast, prescription pharmaceuticals  (Rx) need to be prescribed by physicians . Their  intervention is essential in the choice of the product. Pricing for prescription products is influenced by the public health care system, which pays (part of) the purchase price via reimbursement. Advertising  is targeted at prescribers, namely , doctors and  hospitals.\nHowever, in certain cases, products which are available OTC can still be reimbursable if bought on prescription. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that OTC and prescription products compete with each other, especially in cases where the sta tus of the drug is not clearly limited to either OTC or prescription."

This class includes platelet aggregation inhibitors (B1AC), heparin groups (B1AB), vitamin K antagonists (B1AA) and enzymes (B1AD). Platelet aggregation inhibitors can be further subdivided into ATC 4 class B1AC (antiplatelet drugs, excluding heparin). The Commission also considered that the relevant product market definition could be further narrowed down to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA or aspirin) based medicines.\nThe Parties submit that the market should be determined at the OTC 3 level. The market would then include all drugs in OTC 3 class 10E1, i rrespective of their molecule.\nThe results of the market investigation were not conclusive as to whether the market should be defined at OTC 3 class level or at ATC 3 or ATC 4 class or molecule level. As explained below, almost all the products within t he OTC 3 class 10E1 are based on acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).\nIn any event, for the purposes of the present case, the exact market definition can be left open, as  no serious doubts arise under any plausible alternative market definition  (OTC3 class  or ATC 3 or ATC 4 class  or molecule)."

In AstraZeneca , the Commission consider ed separate relevant markets at the ATC 4 level for PPIs (A2B2). Most recently, in Sanofi/Boehringer -Ingelheim , the Commission's market investigation indicated that a distinction should be made between ATC 4 class A2B1 and ATC 4 class A2B2.

More specifically, antivirals designed to treat herpes are part of the ATC4 class J5B3 (Herpes antivirals).\nIn one previous de cision, the Commission considered that the ATC3 class J5B should be considered as a starting point for the assessment. The Commission however added that drugs treating influenza and drugs treating herpes are not substitutable so that the relevant market c ould be limited to anti -herpes drugs. In this decision, there is no consideration  on a possible segmentation of the market based on molecule.\nThe Notifying Party submits that Rx and OTC anti -herpes drugs are not in the same market . More specifically, the N otifying Party considers that the indication for the Rx product is much broader than for OTC products . PGT OTC product is indicated only for the treatment of diagnosed recurrent herpes simplex labialis (or oral herpes, affecting the mouth), while Teva Rx p roduct is indicat ed for the treatment of any infection of the skin and mucus membranes (including genital herpes), the treatment of varicella etc. The Notifying Party adds that Teva's Rx product is significantly cheaper than PGT's similar OTC product, resp ectively EUR 7.52 with a 40% reimbursement and EUR 10.90 with no reimbursement.\nThe Notifying Party also considers that should Rx and OTC be part of the same market, the market should be defined at the ATC3 level J5B or at the very least at the ATC4 leve l J5B3.\nIn any event, for the purposes of the present case, the exact market definition can be left open  as no  serious doubts arise under any plausible alternative market definition (namely, at ATC3 or ATC4/OTC3 level  or molecule )."

    "topic": "\"Appropriate use\" as \"absence of Misuse\"",
    "text": "Clause 1.10 of the Commitments, which is the one market defining Grandfathering , does not market definition \u201cappropriate use \u201d and does not set a specific standard for such appropriate use . The Commission therefore considers the object and the context of the Commitments as relevant to interpret \"appropriate use\".\nAs regard s the object of the Commitments , the Commission considers that the Commitments aim to remedy serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Transaction with the internal market in relation to the London -Phila delphia route, as explained in paragraph 8 above. Clause 1.9 of the Commitments refers to the purpose of the Slot Commitment, which is restoring competition on that route by establishing a Competitive Air Service. Clause 1.9 of the Commitments does not con tain any reference to a specific number of frequencies on the route. In addition, Competitive Air Service is defined as \" a non -stop scheduled passenger air transport service operated on the Airport Pair \" , therefore not requiring the take -up or servicing o f any particular minimum  number of frequencies  by a Prospective Entrant .\nAs regards  the context of the Commitments, the Commission considers that , as explained in paragraph 47 above, Grandfathering rights constitute an incentive for the Prospective Entran t to operate the London -Philadelphia route. To  entice entry by a competitor, the Prospective Entrant needs clear and verifiable  principles, as well as legal certainty, notably concerning the award of Grandfathering rights, in order to decide whether or not  to apply for the Slots. This requires that the Prospective Entrant can trust that the criterion for obtaining Grandfathering rights is clearly circumscribed and not subject to arbitrary considerations.\nConsidering that in the ordinary  language \"misuse\" can be defined as \" an occasion when something is used in an unsuitable way or in a way that was not intended \" and that \"appropriate\" can be defined as \" suitable or right for a particular situation o r occasion \" , the most evident conclusion is  that \"appropriate use\" is the opposite of \"misuse\". Consequently, when applying a literal interpretation of the concepts used in the Commitments, the appropriate use of the Slots should be understood as the absence of Misuse of these Slots.\nMisuse is market defined in Clause 1.13 of the Commitments, while \u201cappropriate use\u201d is not market defined. The existence of a market definition of \"Misuse\" and the absence of a market definition of \"appropriate use\" in the Commitments points towards an  equation between \"appropriate use\" and \"absence of Misuse\". Therefore, Misuse of the Slots arises under a number of circumstances listed under Clause 1.13; a contrario,  the situation which does not give rise to Misuse can be considered as \u201cappropriate use\u201d of the Slots.  By referring back to a market defined concept in the Commitments, this is the only interpretation (as opposed to the interpretation provided by American Airlines, see below in Section III.1.3.2) that would give sufficiently clear and verifiable  guidance to the Prospective Entrant and would fulfil the requirements of legal certainty ."

    "topic": "\"Appropriate use\" is not \"use in accordance with the bid\"",
    "text": "First, the Commission considers that equating \"appropriate use\" to \"use in accordance with the bid\" would lead to an almost impossible requirement for any airline. A requirement to be strictl y bound by a business plan for the following six IATA Seasons would deprive the Prospective Entrant of any flexibility to operate the Slots in a commercially viable manner. In such scenario, cancelling even one flight (resulting in deviating from the busin ess plan) would prevent the Prospective Entrant from  count ing the whole relevant IATA Season as part of the Utili zation Period and would reset the count for the six consecutive IATA Seasons to acquire Grandfathering rights to zero. In practice, virtually n o airline operates 100% of its initially scheduled frequencies in accordance with a pre -defined business plan, which can be up to 2 -3 years old, especially on routes where operations are starting anew. In addition, the \" use it or lose it \" rule does not req uire an air carrier to demonstrate 100% usage of the slots during the relevant scheduling period in order to be entitled to the same slots in the next equivalent scheduling period. This demonstrates that the EU legislator considered that a 100% utilisation  rate is not an attainable or desirable threshold.\nSecond, American Airlines\u2019 argument that only cancellations for \" extraordinary operational reasons\" would be in compliance with \"use in accordance with the bid\"  is not convincing either . In addition to the  reasons set out in the previous paragraph , such interpretation would  introduce a concept that cannot be objectively market defined in the notion of \"appropriate use\u201d of the Slots.  This could lead to arbitrary decisions and cast legal uncertainty on how the Commi tments should be applied.  There is no specific indication anywhere in the Commitments that would lend support to such an interpretation or would indicate such a threshold. The Commission considers that  the only clear, verifiable, predictable and reasonable  rule to assess \"appropriate use\" is the absence of \u201cMisuse\u201d. In terms of the number of Frequencies that should accordingly be flown, Clause 1.13 of the Commitments, market defining \u201cMisuse\u201d, refers to the \" use it or lose it \" rule included in the EU Slot Regulati on. This is de facto  the standard in the aviation sector market defining the minimum use of slots that entitles an air carrier to the same series of slots in the next equivalent scheduling period. Only this interpretation gives legal certainty t o the Prospective Entrant. Any other threshold would create legal uncertainty .\nThird, the interpretation of \"appropriate use\" as \"in accordance with the bid\" described in paragraphs 59 and 60 above would have a detrimental effect on the attractiveness of the Commitments. They would undermine the purpose of the Grandfathering rights and would ultimately  render it very difficult, if not impossible, to find a Prospective Entrant. Therefore , such interpretations would reduce the likelihood of success of the Co mmitments and would run counter to the object and context of the Commitments as explained above (paragraphs 54 -57).\nFourth, requiring the Prospective Entrant to demonstrate a level of slot utilisation superior to the de facto  standard in the aviation sect or of 80% (as described in paragraph 61 above) would not be justifiable. The purpose of the Commitments is to contribute to restoring a Competitive Air Service on the London -Philadelphia route by enabling a competitor to enter the route  and exert an effect ive competitive constraint . Given that the merged entity\u2019s operation on this route is subject to the \u201c use it or lose it \u201d rule, i t would be unreasonable to require from  Delta , as a remedy taker, to operate according to  a utilisation rate which would be more  burdensome . A higher utilisation rate is in any event not required to operate a Competitive Air Service and thus to exert an effective competitive constraint.\nFifth, the Form RM submitted by American Airlines in the pro cedure leading up to the Clearance Decision states  that the Commitments are largely similar to the commitments offered by IAG in the IAG/bmi merger case. With the exception of an exhaustive list of points diverging from the IAG/bmi case as set out in the Form RM and which do not include the issue of Grandfathering, the Form RM clarifies that any formulation used in the Commitments which differs from the commitments in the IAG/bmi case are only \"minor linguistic changes and clarifications \". While the commi tments in the IAG/bmi case refer to \"appropriate use\", they do not require using the slots during the Utilization Period \"in accordance with the bid\". It follows that the formulation \"in accordance with the bid\" in the Commitments does not amount to a chan ge of the requirements for Grandfathering in the present case and only constitutes a \"minor linguistic change\" as compared to the commitments in the IAG/bmi case.\nSixth, according to American Airlines, Clause 1.9 clarifies that the Prospective Entrant sho uld use the Slots in accordance with the bid. However, as mentioned in paragraph 55 above, Clause 1.9 of the Commitments refers to the purpose of the Slot Commitment , (i.e. to provide a Competitive Air Service on the Airport Pair) . It does not refer  to Grandfathering rights. Accordingly, Clause 1.9 of the Commitments does not contain any reference to \"appropriate use\", the latter being the condition to the granting of Grandfathering rights. Clause 1.10 of the Commitments, on the other hand, introduce s the concept of \"appropriate use\" in the context of granting Grandfathering rights. Therefore, operating the Slots \"in accordance with the bid\"  is not a condition for the granting of Grandfathering rights.\nTherefore, it stems from the wording, the object and the context of the Commitments that \"appropriate use\"  cannot be understood as \"use in accordance with the bid\" ."

However, in the recent Shell/BG case, the Commission found that the upstream wholesale supply of LNG c ould form a separate product market from the upstream wholesale supply of natural gas by pipeline (i.e., non-liquefied natural gas).\nThe Notifying Party contends that th e segmentation of the product market between LNG and piped/non-liquefied gas is  artificial because the two: (i) are perfectly interchangeable; (ii) are in di rect competition; a nd, (iii) their price dynamics are closely correlated.\nThough not entirely conclusive, the outcome  of the market investigation carried out in the present case reveals that L NG and non-liquefied natural gas present distinguishing features.\nFirst, the market investig ation confirmed that LNG was not substitutable with piped natural gas for certain applications. As a respondent indicated: \" Although NG and LNG could be used interchange ably for most of applications, LNG could be used for heavy transporta tion, either vessels or trucks\" .\nSecond, the market investigation indica ted that LNG is in principle more flexible than non-liquefied natural gas, notably in terms of delivery destination. Overall, the investigation also revealed  that flexibility may depend on various conditions and variables that are not necessarily identical for LNG and non-liquefied natural gas.\nThird, the market investigation elicited mi xed results in terms of similarity of the prices for LNG and non-liquefi ed natural gas, respectively. T h e  m a r k e t investigation also indicated that a dire ct correlation between the price of LNG and non-liquefied natural gas is difficult to establish. For example, a competitor explained that \" an historical analysis of av ailable price data lead us to say that LNG prices in the world are generally higher than pipeline gas \", while another one explained that \" [i]t depends on the specific case, including market as well as contractual conditions . LNG might in some cases be priced higher than pipe gas based on a higher  degree of destination flexibility \"."

    "text": "In the past, the Commission considered th e existence of a market encompassing the development, production and upstream  wholesale supply of natural gas, which would also comprise the liquefaction of gas into LNG. However, in Shell/BG, the Commission found that the liquef action of natural gas into LNG could constitute a separate product market, upstream to the (upstream) wholesale supply of LNG.\nThe Notifying Party claims that ther e is no meaningful competition at liquefaction level and that the appropriate  market definition is the broader one including liquefaction into the upstrea m wholesale supply of natural gas.\nThe market investigation carried out in the present case has revealed that there are certain \u2013 mainly US \u2013 companies of fering liquefaction services on a stand-alone basis (via tolling arrangements). Ho wever, customers of the Parties do not normally source liquefaction services inde pendently of the procurement of the gas; for the same reason, they most often don't have a choice of liquefaction facility. Generally, the competitors of the Parties have indicated that they do not provide liquefaction services on a stand-alone basis service to other upstream wholesale suppliers. Moreover, a number of competitors of the Parties do not own equity rights in liquef action plants and some of them do not hold off-take rights from liquefaction plants either.\nThe Commission therefore understands that  liquefaction may be part of the logistics involved in the upstream wholesal e supply of LNG or part of a separate market for the sale of LNG to wholesalers at liquefaction facilities. In any event, if the liquefaction of  natural gas was to  be considered as a product market separate from the upstream wholesale s upply market, it would be upstream of it since customers sourcing liquefaction serv ices are the upstream wholesalers who then sell on the liquefied gas."

Certain customers indicated that faced with a small but significant and non-transitory increase in the price of LNG regasifi cation services, they could switch to importing (more) gas via international pipelines. The willingness to perform such a switch is however described as de pendent on other factors, including the price difference between LNG and non-liq uefied natural gas and the geographic area to which the gas (or LNG) is imported, due to the difference of import infrastructure in each member state.\nCertain competitors of the Parties also  indicated that, faced with small but significant and non-transitory increase in price of rega sification services, they could switch to procuring more gas volum es via international pipelines, at least to the extent that other factors also point  toward a need to rebalance the mix of supply between LNG and non-liquefied natural gas. For example, one competitor explained that \"[t] rading of natural gas is  price sensitive.

In particular, while certain customers and competitors responding to the market investigation share the view that prices of LNG are not homogenous in the EEA and that price differences across Member St ates or groups of Member States can be material, others consider that, independently on regional variations, e.g., between Northern and Southern Europe, prices  are fairly correlated across Europe."

Nonetheless, the Commission noted that from a direct demand perspective there is no substitutability across different AIs for crop protection product manufacturers. This is because each crop protection manufacturer can only rely on a specific AI for the production of its registered crop protection product. Indeed, each crop protection product registration authorizes the use of specific AIs, which cannot be substituted or changed unless a new product registration application is filed. Therefore, the Commission considered each AI as a distinct product market. In the present case, there is no reason to depart from the well-established decisional practice described above.

    "topic": "Herbicides",
    "text": "Herbicides are crop protection products that control weeds. In previous cases, the Commission has considered a distinction between (i) selective herbicides and (ii) non-selective herbicides. Non-selective herbicides are defined as crop protection products designed to tackle weeds after the harvest of any crop and prior to the sowing of the next. In contrast, selective herbicides are created to kill only the weeds while leaving intact the crop to which they are applied. In addition, within selective herbicides, the Commission has concluded that the different types of crops constitute relevant segmentations. Within selective herbicides for cereals, the Commission has considered that a distinction among wheat herbicides, barley herbicides, and \"other cereal\" herbicides is appropriate. This conclusion is based on the principle that each farmer has specific needs for its crop/pest combinations that can only be met by selective herbicides products which will target and be effective on its specific crop. In previous decisions, the Commission also concluded on a further distinction between the following selective herbicides: (i) broadleaf weed herbicides, (ii) graminicides (control of grass weeds) and (iii) broad spectrum herbicides (products active against both grass weeds and broadleaf weeds). Indeed, if a farmer faces harmful grass weeds or broadleaf weeds in his crop fields, he needs to use herbicides capable of controlling these particular weeds. Moreover, the Commission considered a distinction within selective herbicides based on the stage of application, notably between (ii) pre-emergence and (iii) post-emergence herbicides. Pre-emergence herbicides are applied to a target crop before it has germinated whereas post-emergence herbicides are applied after germination. In the present case, there is no reason to depart from the decisional practice described above. Therefore, the relevant product markets to retain for the competitive analysis of the Transaction are: selective herbicides segmented by specific crop, by specific weed targeted and by timing of their application."

Furthermore, previous Commission decisions found further possible distinctions by reference to particular diseases relevant for each crop. For instance, the Commission noted that distinctions could be made between fungicides against powdery mildew, fusarium, rusts, eyes pot and septoria. In the present case, there is no reason to depart from the decisional practice described above.

Furthermore, the Commission also considered that it was relevant to distinguish insecticides according to the type of pest, namely between chewing or sucking pests, notably to ensure the effectiveness of the product.

Moreover, these products are labelled and branded differently on the basis of the country in which they are being commercialized. Furthermore, in past decisions, the Commission took into account the fact that distribution is organized on a national basis, with suppliers having in most cases national sales organizations or distributing via the sales organization of another manufacturer operating in the relevant Member State.

The result of this analysis is that no horizontal overlap exists. With respect to vertical overlaps, Rivopharm does not have any outlicensing activities for the molecule/country pairs which are included in the Divestment Business. However, a vertical overlap exists for gabapentin in Sweden as Rivopharm supplies gabapentin to one customer which sells the product under its own brand and livery. This vertical overlap is however unlikely to give rise to any prima facie competition concern for the following reasons. First, Rivopharm's customer is the marketing authori sation holder and thus is the one selling this product . Second, in 2016, the combined market share of Rivopharm's product and the Divested Product was below the 30% threshold both in value (21%) and volume (14%) .

It argues that it would not be appropriate to sub-segment the market further based on end application, for exa mple for use in: (i) PVC; (ii) polyamides; or (iii) polyurethane (\"PU\"); because the same type of flame retardants can be used for different applications and different types of flame retardants can be used for the same application. The Commission has previously noted that flame retardants can differ depending on the chemistry used or on the basis of the application but that manufacturers of flame retardants can use different inputs to achieve flame retardants with comparable characteristics. The Commission found that the market could potentially be sub-segmented by type but it ultimately left the market definition open, undertaking the assessment based on the market broken down by chemistry and end application. The market investigation was inconclusive as to whether it would be appropriate to further segment the market according to chemistry used. The vast majority of respondents consider that flame retardants based on different chemistries can be used for the same end applications in some cases, but not all. In turn, the market investigation was also inconclusive as to whether it could be appropriate to sub-segment either phosphorus or bromine based flame retardants according to end use. The vast majority of respondents consider that products based on a particular chemistry are partially interchangeable in that they can be used for some end-applications, but not all. In particular, a slight majority consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PVC applications and the majority of respondents consider that certain phosphorus based flame retardants are better suited for PU applications. A horizontally affected market arises in relation to bromine based flame retardants and a few market participants raised concerns regarding phosphorus based flame retardants which are therefore considered below in the competitive assessment. For the purpose of the present decision, the exact scope of the product market definition for flame retardants and its sub-segments therein can be left open, since no serious doubts as to the compatibility of the Proposed Transaction with the internal market arise, regardless of whether the market is considered to be broken down by chemistry or further broken down by end application."

The Commission has not previously considered the scope of the product market with respect to the inclusion of corner modules for trailers. For the purpose of this decision, the exact product market definition can be left open since the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any alternative product market definition considered."

    "text": "The explanations in recitals (10) to (22) of this Decision show that the same underlying methodology was applied to all addressees of the 2014 Decision in order to adjust their respective basic amounts according to their particular situation. The explanations also show why the Commission decided to apply different individual reductions and the elements that were taken into account when setting those reductions. In its reply to the letter of 29 March 2017, Printeos also claimed that the adjusted basic amounts showed a clear discrepancy as regards the 10% legal maximum. However, contrary to what Printeos seems to suggest, the reductions were not set at a level that would ensure that the relationship between the adjusted basic amounts and the overall turnover would be the same for all parties. It also must be borne in mind, that according to settled case-law it is not contrary to the principles of proportionality and equal treatment that, through the application of the method of calculation of the basic amount of fines, an undertaking may receive a fine which represents a proportion of its overall turnover that is greater than that represented by the fines imposed respectively on each of the other undertakings. The Commission considers that the methodology used takes into account the parties\u2019 positions in a non-discriminatory manner and results in fair, proportionate and sufficiently deterrent fines for all addressees of the 2014 Decision. The Commission does therefore not see the need to grant a higher reduction to Printeos. \n(60) The resulting adjusted and adapted basic amounts for all undertakings were set out in Table 4 of the 2014 Decision (which is reproduced below). For Printeos, the adjusted basic amount is EUR [...]."
