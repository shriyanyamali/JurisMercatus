The notifying party submits that dividing OEM infotainment systems by\nthe functionalities they provide or the devices they use to provide such functionalities\nwould artificially create a myriad of product markets that would not capture the\ncompetition among OEM infotainment system providers to meet the demands of OEMs\nand consumers for integrated solutions. The notifying party submits that all infotainment\nsystems possess the following common characteristics which distinguish them from the\nmarkets for the individual components or peripherals that may be included in such\nsystems:\n\n• certain hardware : i.e., a central computing platform, commonly known as the\nhead unit\"\n• certain software: i.e., Operating System, software which enables the driver to\ncommand and control the various entertainment and information devices that\nconnect to the 'head unit' so that they can all operate together as an integrated\nsystem via a common driver interface,\n• a control or gateway interface function to the overall vehicle network.\n\n14. All infotainment system competitors in the Commission's market investigation agreed\nthat infotainment systems share certain hardware and software including the 'head unit'.\nOne respondent however did not agree that all such systems have a control or gateway\ninterface function to the overall vehicle network.

Responses in the market investigation from both infotainment system suppliers and\nOEM customers indicated that the geographic market for such systems may in fact be\nglobal as suppliers are active in all main markets and major customers source such\nsystems on a global basis. One respondent nuanced this view by noting the widespread\nuse of the MOST\ndata communication protocol in European manufactured vehicles as\nopposed to those manufactured elsewhere.

The notifying party considers on the basis of certain supply and demand considerations\nthat FOTs can be divided into three categories: automotive, general purpose (or\nnetworking) and industrial. Automotive FOTs can be distinguished from other types of\nFOT in that they comply with standard specifications used in the automotive industry\n(namely the Byteflight or MOST specifications). Although automotive FOTs can in\ntheory be used in a number of non-automotive applications, customers in the automotive\nindustry will not accept non-automotive FOTs. This was confirmed by respondents in\nthe market investigation.\n\n24. Industrial and general purpose FOTs are differentiated from automotive FOTs in that\nthey are not required to meet the Byteflight or MOST specifications. General purpose\n(or networking) FOTs have different optical solutions from automotive and industrial\nFOTs as they use different lasers/detectors and combine the transmitting and receiving\nfunction into a single package and operate on either a multimode or single mode optical\nfiber. As industrial FOTs are not used by Harman in any of its applications, they are not\nconsidered further. Similarly, as the Byteflight data protocol is being phased out and\nbecause Harman uses only MOST automotive FOTs in its infotainment systems, the\nsubsequent analysis focuses on MOST automotive FOTs.\n\n25. For the purposes of the present case however the precise product market definition may\nbe left open as the proposed transaction will not result in a significant impediment to\neffective competition even on the basis of the narrowest product market definition of\nautomotive FOTs where Avago's market share is the highest."

The market investigation was  however  inconclusive as to at what price bags and SLGs cease to be mass market  goods , and at which price they go beyond being a premium or accessible luxury product  and become a high- end or true luxury product.  (27) For example, one competitor noted that the premium market for bags would be \u201c in the range of 200- 500\u20ac\u201d, while mass market would be \u201c below 200\u20ac\u201d. In the same vein, a  retailer mentioned that in its \u201c premium \u201d section, the average selling price would be \u201c 300 euros \u201d. As noted above, one retailer  explained that \u201din the higher end, Kering and LVHM are extremely powerful and able to price their bags at  over EUR 2,000\u201d  while  the Parties\u2019 brands Michael Kors or Coach  are priced  \u201cwell below EUR 1,000\u201d.

(28) The Commission observes that respondents to the market investigation consistently considered the Parties\u2019 Michael Kors, Coach and Kate Spade brands to be in the luxury market while in fact, the Parties\u2019 sales data indicates that [\u2026]  of their sales for bags are in the EUR 0 \u2013 200 price bracket and EUR 0 \u2013 100 for SLGs.

        "text": "In its previous decisions, the Commission has not considered whether a distinction between high-speed and non high-speed passenger rail services needs to be made. The Notifying Parties submit that Italo is only active as an operator of the high-speed rail network in Italy, which is separate from trains on the non-high speed part of the Italian rail network. The Notifying Parties have therefore provided market share data for Italo (and its only competitor Trenitalia) for the high-speed passenger rail market in Italy on an O&D basis. For completeness, the Commission has, in previous decisions, also considered whether a potential sub-segmentation on the basis of the passenger category (distinguishing between time-sensitive and non-time sensitive passengers)  would be relevant but ultimately left the exact market definition open, as the relevance of the distinction appeared to depend to a large extent on the particulars of the markets concerned. The Notifying Parties have not considered this distinction, which does not appear to apply in the present case as Italo is, as noted above, only active as an operator of the high-speed rail passenger network, which is only relevant for time-sensitive passengers. Given that the Transaction would not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition, the exact product and geographic market definition can be left open and in particular whether the market should be further segmented by distinguishing between time-sensitive and non-time sensitive passengers."

The Parties also consider that leasing platforms for bikes and e -bikes are part of the same market.  (17) To date, the Commission has not analysed bike leasing or  digital platform services in the area of (bike) leasing in -depth . In previous decisions relating to automotive leasing services, the Commission defined a market for operational leasing services, distinct from a market for financial leasing, th at includes the leasing of the vehicle whose ownership remains with the leasing company coupled by the provision of a range of fleet management services, such as maintenance, repair, fuel cards, tyre replacement, and insurance. (18) Automotive leasing has c haracteristics which apply also to bike leasing, and the processes are largely similar. During the Commission\u2019s  investigation, a  bike leasing platform explained that while the digital system is slightly adapted for each  type of vehicle leasing , the backend operation is the same . In a similar vein, a bike leasing service provider indicated that it uses the same core platform for both car and bike leasing services. (19) Bike leasing is a nascent market sector subject to dynamic evolution. The market for digital bike leasing platforms appears to be separate from that for bike leasing because it is a service that can be provided separately, with platform providers not necessarily being active also upstream in bike leasing themselves. While market participants contacted in the course of the Commission\u2019s  investigation suggest ed that various business models exist in respect of these activities that may be vertically integrated,  it appears that bike leasing providers do not consider bike leasing platforms as their competitors."

The majority of responding customers assess and interpret the metering data in -house and a small minority of customers rely on another supplier than its metering supplier.29 For the purpose of this Decision, the question can however be left open as the Transaction does not lead to an overlap on the possible segment for the assessment and interpretation of metering data with  a specific objective.30"
