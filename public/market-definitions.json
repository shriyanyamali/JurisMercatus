        "text": "In past decisions, the Commission considered that each of the markets for the supply of cat food and dog food could be further segmented: (i) between dry food, wet food and snacks and (ii) between branded products and products for private labels at the wholesale level. However, the Commission considered that different quality categories of pet food were not deemed to form separate relevant product markets. The outcome of the market investigation in the present case confirmed the Commission\u2019s previous decisions. The results of the market investigation confirmed that dry food, wet food and snacks should be considered to belong to different product markets. On the demand side, dry food is less expensive and can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration, while wet food offers higher hydration and palatability particularly for pets with specific health needs or preferences. Snacks are generally used as treats, but do not provide a balanced nutrition and therefore cannot substitute dry or wet food. On the supply side, these products are manufactured on distinct production lines with entirely different technical processes and dedicated packaging. The results of the market investigation also confirmed the relevance of a segmentation between branded product and products for private labels at the wholesale level. On the demand side, these products address clearly distinct use cases for retailers: the formulation and packaging of products for private labels are customized to the specific retailer and are labelled with the retailer\u2019s own brand, while branded products feature the supplier\u2019s own brand and are made available to several retailers in the same format. On the supply side, although the same production lines can in principle be used to produce both branded products and products for private labels, the supply base in these two segments is significantly different. This is because the main suppliers of branded products (such as Mars and Nestl\u00e9) are large, sophisticated conglomerates focusing on the promotion of their own brands and are not active (or no longer active) in the supply of products for private labels. Conversely, producers for private labels are generally smaller in size. And even if some of them also offer a range of branded products, this offering is often rather marginal and in any case much smaller than the abovementioned branded suppliers. With respect to quality categories, the results of market investigation confirmed that, although consumers often have a preference for one or the other quality tier, these different categories exist in a continuum and respondents were not able to indicate clearcut criteria demarcating the boundaries of each segment. Moreover, most suppliers producing pet food of different quality categories do so on the same production lines with no or minor adjustments to the manufacturing process. Therefore, in line with its past decisions, in the present case the Commission assessed market shares for the supply of cat and dog food at wholesale level distinguishing between dry food, wet food and snacks and between branded and private label products."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s past decisions concluded that the relevant geographic market is national in scope for branded products and larger than national (and possibly EEA-wide) for private label product at the wholesale level. This difference stems from the fact that private label products are not advertised by their supplier, as any advertising for private label products is done by the retailer. Producers may therefore afford higher transport costs and still offer the product at competitive prices compared to the branded pet food. Therefore, manufacturers of private label can competitively sell such products throughout an extensive area, which is wider than national. Moreover, some international hypermarket chains tend to carry out their procurement policies for private label purchases in a context which is wider than national. In the present case, the large majority of responding suppliers indicated that their European plants are able to deliver their branded and private label products in most of the EU territory and even to other continents. The large majority of responding retailers similarly indicated that they are able to procure branded and private label products from producers located in most of the European territory. In any event, the geographic market can be left open, because the transaction does not raise any concerns even under the most conservative approach (i.e. assuming a national scope of the relevant markets)."

The market investigation in the present case confirmed this conclusion. From the point of view of the upstream producers (which is particularly relevant in this case), the different distribution channels are seen to a large extent as interchangeable, because producers supply the same products across channels with no or minor adjustments. Suppliers also explained that they are able to shift volumes among different channels in response to changes in market demand. Also from the point of view of downstream consumers, grocery and specialist outlets are seen as competing against each other and consumers often buy products in both channels. The Commission\u2019s precedent (dating back to more than 20 years ago) did not mention sales on online platforms. The market investigation in the present case showed that customers easily switch between online and brick-and-mortar shops and suppliers increasingly pursue omni-channel strategies that span both online and offline sales. The Commission therefore considers that the overall market for the retail of pet food also includes online sales."

These agreements thus provide the legal basis for a global integration of the companies\u2019 networks and commercial policies. Furthermore, the scope of and rationale for these agreements go beyond the bundle of routes between Germany and their respective home countries.

According to the majority of both customers and suppliers MCC is not, or only to a limited extent substitutable for other excipients (such as lactose), as MCC has unique chemical properties and substitutes such as lactose are often not substitutes as there is a trend to providing lactose-free formulas. The market investigation also indicates that there may be a segmentation between MCC for pharmaceutical and MCC for nutraceutical applications. On the one hand, MCC for pharmaceuticals may have a price premium that makes it uneconomical to use it in nutraceuticals. On the other hand, MCC for nutraceuticals can only be used in pharmaceuticals if it complies with a pharmacopoeia such as the European pharmacopoeia. While the production process for both types of MCC is similar, there is a stronger emphasis on quality control and consistent quality for MCC for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, there may be limited substitutability between MCC for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, but the results of the market investigation are not entirely conclusive on this point, as the production process for all types of MCC is similar and there is an overlap of certain grades being used for both applications, which speaks in favour of not segmenting the market by end-application."

Further, the market investigation supports a possible further segmentation of the FCU market according to: (i) intended use (i.e., residential vs non-residential FCUs), (ii) based on the number of tubes (i.e., FCUs with two tubes and FCUs with four tubes) and (iii) design (i.e. classical FCUs that are free standing on the floor and non-classical FCUs that are mounted in the wall or ceiling).

Size and capacity of FCUs are the most cited distinguishing factors, with residential FCUs normally being smaller in size and having a lower heating/cooling capacity than non-residential FCUs. In terms of capacity, some respondent suggested that residential FCUs could be < 8kW and non-residential FCUs > 8kW. It was also mentioned that FCUs for residential use are \u2018quieter\u2019, \u2018thinner\u2019 and with better aesthetics (having excellent finishes and being made by metal sheets rather than plastic). Internal documents of the Parties appear to support a segmentation based on intended use. In addition, a due diligence report refers to a \u2018residential ventilation segment\u2019.

        "text": "The Commission has previously found that the market for the production and supply of non-alcoholic beverages was further segmented into the production and supply of carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated soft drinks, which were found to constitute two separate product markets. Within non-carbonated soft drinks, the Commission has considered that water and ready-to-drink teas belong to separate product markets. The Commission has considered further potential segmentations within non-carbonated soft drinks (namely fruit juices, energy and sport drinks), but has ultimately left this question open. In particular, the Commission left open the question of whether dilutables (e.g. squashes and syrups) compete with other soft drinks. In the present case, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition can be left open. If dilutables were part of the wider market of soft drink (either carbonated or not, depending on the beverage mixed with the dilutable), no affected markets would arise in relation to these products. If dilutables were part of a separate market, that market would be vertically affected but \u2013 for the reasons explained in the following sections \u2013 the Transaction would not raise competition concerns."

Moreover, the Commission has considered, but ultimately left open, a potential distinction of the market for the wholesale distribution of beverages depending on whether beverages are sold to retail outlets (\u2018off trade\u2019 channel) or to points of sale for direct consumption, e.g. restaurants or hotels (\u2018on trade\u2019 channel).

In particular, all retailers interviewed by the Commission confirmed that wafers represent a specific product category in Slovakia and Czechia. This segmentation is also reflected in the Nielsen IQ data categorisation. One retailer affirmed that \u2018Wafers is a specific product category recognised by the industry [.]\u2019, while another specified that \u2018[\u2026] given that they are a very particular product in Slovakia because of their brand recognition and tradition (i.e., Horalky, Mila), wafers could be considered a market distinct from the rest of biscuits.\u2019 Furthermore, the Parties, in their internal documents, assess the market for the supply of wafers as separate from that of other products. For instance, Target\u2019s internal documents analysing its market position both in Czechia and Slovakia highlight that wafers are [\u2026], meaning [\u2026]. Another internal document from the Target highlights that IDC Holding has, in Czechia, [\u2026]."

Branded labels are products with the trademark and/or logo of the supplier that is supplied to more retailers or other purchasers\u2019, and that \u2018several of the Company\u2019s suppliers cannot produce private labels for various reasons and only produce branded products\u2019."

The market investigation confirmed strong national identity of tastes in biscuits, chocolate confectionery, countlines and wafers and their segments. For example, wafers enjoy particularly strong market position in Czech Republic and Slovakia, with several traditional brands well anchored in the local consumer preferences. The local relevance of brands was confirmed by one of the retailers who assumed that \u2018IDC Holding certainly exports its products to neighbouring countries but it can take place under different brands and with different taste\u2019."

Ground-mount systems are installed on the ground in open areas and predominantly as part of larger projects. Rooftop solar mounting systems are installed on roofs and predominantly used for smaller projects. Moreover, ground-mount systems are typically more complex, customised for each project, comprise fewer different components, and are associated with ancillary services, such as geological surveys, design, project management, installation, and training. Rooftop solar mounting systems are simpler and more standardised, and do not include a similar set of support services."
