        "text": "In past decisions, the Commission considered that each of the markets for the supply of cat food and dog food could be further segmented: (i) between dry food, wet food and snacks and (ii) between branded products and products for private labels at the wholesale level. However, the Commission considered that different quality categories of pet food were not deemed to form separate relevant product markets. The outcome of the market investigation in the present case confirmed the Commission\u2019s previous decisions. The results of the market investigation confirmed that dry food, wet food and snacks should be considered to belong to different product markets. On the demand side, dry food is less expensive and can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration, while wet food offers higher hydration and palatability particularly for pets with specific health needs or preferences. Snacks are generally used as treats, but do not provide a balanced nutrition and therefore cannot substitute dry or wet food. On the supply side, these products are manufactured on distinct production lines with entirely different technical processes and dedicated packaging. The results of the market investigation also confirmed the relevance of a segmentation between branded product and products for private labels at the wholesale level. On the demand side, these products address clearly distinct use cases for retailers: the formulation and packaging of products for private labels are customized to the specific retailer and are labelled with the retailer\u2019s own brand, while branded products feature the supplier\u2019s own brand and are made available to several retailers in the same format. On the supply side, although the same production lines can in principle be used to produce both branded products and products for private labels, the supply base in these two segments is significantly different. This is because the main suppliers of branded products (such as Mars and Nestl\u00e9) are large, sophisticated conglomerates focusing on the promotion of their own brands and are not active (or no longer active) in the supply of products for private labels. Conversely, producers for private labels are generally smaller in size. And even if some of them also offer a range of branded products, this offering is often rather marginal and in any case much smaller than the abovementioned branded suppliers. With respect to quality categories, the results of market investigation confirmed that, although consumers often have a preference for one or the other quality tier, these different categories exist in a continuum and respondents were not able to indicate clearcut criteria demarcating the boundaries of each segment. Moreover, most suppliers producing pet food of different quality categories do so on the same production lines with no or minor adjustments to the manufacturing process. Therefore, in line with its past decisions, in the present case the Commission assessed market shares for the supply of cat and dog food at wholesale level distinguishing between dry food, wet food and snacks and between branded and private label products."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s past decisions concluded that the relevant geographic market is national in scope for branded products and larger than national (and possibly EEA-wide) for private label product at the wholesale level. This difference stems from the fact that private label products are not advertised by their supplier, as any advertising for private label products is done by the retailer. Producers may therefore afford higher transport costs and still offer the product at competitive prices compared to the branded pet food. Therefore, manufacturers of private label can competitively sell such products throughout an extensive area, which is wider than national. Moreover, some international hypermarket chains tend to carry out their procurement policies for private label purchases in a context which is wider than national. In the present case, the large majority of responding suppliers indicated that their European plants are able to deliver their branded and private label products in most of the EU territory and even to other continents. The large majority of responding retailers similarly indicated that they are able to procure branded and private label products from producers located in most of the European territory. In any event, the geographic market can be left open, because the transaction does not raise any concerns even under the most conservative approach (i.e. assuming a national scope of the relevant markets)."

The market investigation in the present case confirmed this conclusion. From the point of view of the upstream producers (which is particularly relevant in this case), the different distribution channels are seen to a large extent as interchangeable, because producers supply the same products across channels with no or minor adjustments. Suppliers also explained that they are able to shift volumes among different channels in response to changes in market demand. Also from the point of view of downstream consumers, grocery and specialist outlets are seen as competing against each other and consumers often buy products in both channels. The Commission\u2019s precedent (dating back to more than 20 years ago) did not mention sales on online platforms. The market investigation in the present case showed that customers easily switch between online and brick-and-mortar shops and suppliers increasingly pursue omni-channel strategies that span both online and offline sales. The Commission therefore considers that the overall market for the retail of pet food also includes online sales."

These agreements thus provide the legal basis for a global integration of the companies\u2019 networks and commercial policies. Furthermore, the scope of and rationale for these agreements go beyond the bundle of routes between Germany and their respective home countries.

According to the majority of both customers and suppliers MCC is not, or only to a limited extent substitutable for other excipients (such as lactose), as MCC has unique chemical properties and substitutes such as lactose are often not substitutes as there is a trend to providing lactose-free formulas. The market investigation also indicates that there may be a segmentation between MCC for pharmaceutical and MCC for nutraceutical applications. On the one hand, MCC for pharmaceuticals may have a price premium that makes it uneconomical to use it in nutraceuticals. On the other hand, MCC for nutraceuticals can only be used in pharmaceuticals if it complies with a pharmacopoeia such as the European pharmacopoeia. While the production process for both types of MCC is similar, there is a stronger emphasis on quality control and consistent quality for MCC for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, there may be limited substitutability between MCC for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, but the results of the market investigation are not entirely conclusive on this point, as the production process for all types of MCC is similar and there is an overlap of certain grades being used for both applications, which speaks in favour of not segmenting the market by end-application."

Further, the market investigation supports a possible further segmentation of the FCU market according to: (i) intended use (i.e., residential vs non-residential FCUs), (ii) based on the number of tubes (i.e., FCUs with two tubes and FCUs with four tubes) and (iii) design (i.e. classical FCUs that are free standing on the floor and non-classical FCUs that are mounted in the wall or ceiling).

Size and capacity of FCUs are the most cited distinguishing factors, with residential FCUs normally being smaller in size and having a lower heating/cooling capacity than non-residential FCUs. In terms of capacity, some respondent suggested that residential FCUs could be < 8kW and non-residential FCUs > 8kW. It was also mentioned that FCUs for residential use are \u2018quieter\u2019, \u2018thinner\u2019 and with better aesthetics (having excellent finishes and being made by metal sheets rather than plastic). Internal documents of the Parties appear to support a segmentation based on intended use. In addition, a due diligence report refers to a \u2018residential ventilation segment\u2019.

The Commission has considered further potential segmentations within non-carbonated soft drinks (namely fruit juices, energy and sport drinks), but has ultimately left this question open.

In the present case, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition can be left open. If dilutables were part of the wider market of soft drink (either carbonated or not, depending on the beverage mixed with the dilutable), no affected markets would arise in relation to these products.

Accordingly, a maximum of 12 daily slot pairs (i.e. the corresponding departure and arrival slots) are available for all the Relevant City Pairs considered together and within that overall limit, a maximum of five daily slot pairs are available for the Identified Long-haul City Pairs and for the London-Nice city pair.\n\nPursuant to Clause 1.1.2 of the Commitments, the number of daily Frequencies available to operate a service on the Identified City Pairs was increased from the original five daily Frequencies to seven daily Frequencies as the two slot pairs provided by IAG to Transaero were returned to IAG at the end of IATA Summer Season 2015. Therefore, at the beginning of the IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, 14 daily slot pairs were available, including seven daily slot pairs for the Identified City Pairs.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, slot pairs were granted to Aeroflot to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2017, slot pairs were granted to Flybe Group Plc (\"Flybe\") for the operation of 25 weekly Frequencies (up to four daily Frequencies) on the London-Edinburgh route and 18 weekly Frequencies (up to three daily Frequencies) on the London-Aberdeen route. For IATA Summer Season 2018, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of one additional weekly Frequency on the London-Aberdeen route (on Sunday) and two additional weekly Frequencies on the London-Edinburgh route (one on Saturday and one on Sunday). Also for IATA Summer Season 2018, Aeroflot was awarded additional slot pairs to operate seven additional weekly Frequencies (one additional daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2019, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of seven weekly Frequencies (i.e. one daily Frequency) on the London-Edinburgh route. For IATA Summer Season 2020, the remaining slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of four additional daily Frequencies on weekdays and on Sunday on the London-Edinburgh route and five additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Edinburgh route; and two additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Aberdeen route.\n\nTherefore, following the Summer 2020 Slot Award Decision, no Slots remained available under Clause 1.1.1(b) of the Commitments.\n\nFollowing Flybe\u2019s entry into administration on 5 March 2020, IAG (via British Airways) served notices to terminate its slot release agreements with Flybe on 5 March 2020 and clawed back the Slots that had been made available and were operated by Flybe pursuant to the Commitments. In total, IAG clawed back slots allowing 84 weekly frequencies.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, the Commission adopted a decision pursuant to Clause 1.3.3 of the Commitments granting Grandfathering rights to Flybe with respect to the Slots granted to it in the Flybe Summer 2017 Slot Award Decision (\"the Flybe 2017 Slots\"; concerning 43 weekly Frequencies).\n\nGiven that (i) a total of 98 weekly Frequencies are to be made available pursuant to Clauses 1.1.1 and 1.1.2; (ii) 14 weekly Frequencies were granted to Aeroflot; and (iii) Flybe has been granted Grandfathering rights with respect to 43 weekly Frequencies, 41 weekly Frequencies remained.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2021/2022, slot pairs were granted to Saudi Arabian Airlines (\"Saudia\") to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Riyadh route. For IATA Summer Season 2022, no Slots were released to applicant airlines. For IATA Winter Season 2022/2023 slot pairs were granted to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air France to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Nice route.\n\nTherefore, for IATA Summer Season 2023, 27 weekly Frequencies are still available under Clause 1.1.1."

        "text": "The relevant product market comprises scheduled passenger air transport services. The analysis focuses on city-pair markets for flights to and from London Heathrow airport (\"Heathrow\"), which is recognised as a highly slot-constrained airport. The Commission\u2019s assessment concentrates on the routes identified within the Commitments, specifically including London -Aberdeen, London -Edinburgh, London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow. The Commitments distinguish between \"Identified UK City Pairs\" (London -Aberdeen and London -Edinburgh) and broader \"Identified City Pairs\" (the latter including the UK pairs as well as London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow). The geographic market is primarily defined narrowly, as flights operating to and from Heathrow only. This focus arises from the congestion and slot constraints at Heathrow, which is the central concern addressed by the Commitments. An analysis of wider markets, including London \"three\" (Heathrow, Gatwick, City) and London \"five\" airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, City, Luton, Stansted), was considered. However, the Commission\u2019s decision and remedies are aimed at addressing competition effects specifically at Heathrow, as highlighted in recital 58 of the Decision and in line with precedent decisions. The term \"London -Moscow\" is interpreted within the scope of the Commitments as Heathrow -Moscow, not encompassing Gatwick. While Gatwick services exist, they were not part of the competition concerns at the time of adoption of the Decision, and hence do not affect the scope of the committed slot releases. The Market Definition section therefore recognizes the relevant markets as scheduled passenger air transport services on the specified city-pairs operating out of Heathrow airport, on which the competitive dynamics and remedies are focused."

However, the results also indicate that the propulsion technologies used in each are fundamentally different.\nAs regards a potential distinction according to the sector in which FCSs are used, the results of the market investigation suggest that the market for the manufacture and supply of FCSs could be segmented according to different end -use applications (e.g., automotive, stationary applications, construction equipment, forklifts, trains, ships) . While some respondents indicate d that currently there may be a certain degree of supply -side substitutability, respondents also indicated that, as the market matures, the differences between FCSs for different applications will be greater.\nIn light of the above, for the purposes of th e present decision, the Commission considers that it can be left open whether the market for the supply of FCSs may be further segmented according to the sector in which FCSs may be used since the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compati bility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement , under any plausible product market definition.

        "text": "With respect of a possible distinction of CRM software solutions based on functionality , the market investigation indicated that there may be  a separate market for the CRM software functionality of customer service and support, whic h also corresponds to a distinction used by Kustomer itself, as well as in third party reports, such as Gartner. From a demand -side perspective, a strong majority of responding market participants (both CRM software providers and business customers) cons idered that CRM software with different functionalities are complementary rather than substitutable and that customer service and support CRM software is the only type of CRM software functionality that is substitutable for Kustomer\u2019s CRM software product . The majority of CRM providers that expressed a view considered it would not be technically possible (or at best only to a limited extent), nor would it be likely from a commercial perspective, for business customers to switch to other CRM software funct ionalities (i.e., other than customer service and support CRM software) in a scenario where the price of customer service and support CRM software increased. From a supply -side perspective, while larger CRM software providers may offer a range of differen t functionalities, smaller players (such as Kustomer) may only offer one or a limited number of functionalities. There was no clear consensus among CRM providers on the ability for a company specialised in other functionalities to start offering customer s ervice and support CRM software in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs . While in the Phase I market investigation, a  majority of respondents that expressed a view said that this  would not be possible in the short term and with out incurring significant investment costs, in the Phase II market investigation, the results were mixed, with several respondents indicating that it would depend on the CRM software provider\u2019s existing capabilities (e.g., existing technology and know -how). In light of the above , the Commission  concludes that, from a demand side perspective, there is a separate market for customer service and support CRM software. To the extent the market would be  wider than customer service and support CRM software, this would thus only be due to supply -side substitutability arguments (i.e., a CRM software provider offering another functionality starting to offer customer service and support CRM software). However , the Commission considers that any CRM software provider active in another segment wanting to start offering customer service and support CRM software would require B2C communication channels as an input, as customer service and support CRM by definition requires interaction with customers, and that the mere fact that some CRM software providers offer multiple functionalities does not establish full supply -side substitutability if starting to offer a different functionality cannot necessarily be done in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs."

There was no consensus between business customers that expressed a view on whether on- premises and cloud- based CRM software solutions are substitutable for one another. From a supply -side perspective, the majority of respondents that expressed a view considered that it would not be possible for a CRM software provider specialised in on -premises solutions to start offering cloud- based CRM solutions in the shor t term and without incurring significant investment costs. However, the market investigation also indicated that a majority of CRM software customers use cloud- based solutions, and most CRM software providers only or primarily offer cloud- based solutions. One market participant indicated that \u201c companies that specialized in on- premise s solutions have or are moving towards offering cloud- based solutions \u201d and a leading CRM software provider  confirmed that it \u201c offers only cloud- based solutions .\u201d The same is  true of Kustomer. Indeed, the majority of respondents that expressed a view also indicated that cloud -based CRM software solutions are either progressively replacing on- premises solutions, or have almost entirely done so. In light of the mixed market inv estigation results and the fact that the majority of the market already appears to be cloud -based/SaaS, the Commission considers that it is not necessary to segment the broader CRM software market or the narrower customer service and support CRM software m arket between SaaS/cloud based solutions on the one hand and on- premises solutions on the other hand. However, the precise segmentation can be left open as the Commission  considers that it is likely, and there is even a strong probability, that the  Transaction would significantly impede effective competition  in both an overall market for customer service and support CRM software and a potential segment for cloud- based customer service and support CRM software solutions (as well as on the broader CRM software solutions  market  and a potential segment for cloud- based CRM software solutions)."

Second, there is a difference in pricing conditions as consumer communications apps are mainly offered for free.

Furthermore, market participants have generally confirmed that prices for MDA are negotiated and set at national level . As one market participant explained, \u201c[w]e have separate agreements for each country. Suppliers have separate organisation in each country \u201d. The fact that these negotiations take place at a national level is fully reflected by the fact that there exist significant price differences between EEA countries . Internal data from the Parties show significant price variations among EEA countries, for similar MDA models. For example, for washing machines, internal data from the Target shows that prices among EEA countries can vary as much as [\u2026]% from the average price .

Thirdly, the market investigation has revealed (i) the importance of brands for the purchasing patterns of final customers and (ii) that brands have varying importance from country to country. For example, one market participant highlighted: \u201cMDA are long-lasting products (i.e., a life cycle of 10-20 years for MDA) and customers thus tend to turn more to brands which they know and trust \u201d. Furthermore, brand positioning is not homogeneous from country to country. Some brands have a higher positioning in some countries, while being much less important in other countries.

As one market participant explained, this segmentation is \u201crelevant because the solutions for each sub -market will in some cases vary from sub-market to sub -market .\u201d Another market participant considered that \u201c[t]his proposed subsegmentation is closer to the business. As an example, different segments have different regulations that impact directly in the quality and the cost o[f] the services. \u201d In contrast, a competitor considered that the segmentation is not warranted, since \u201c Clients expect BPO service providers to offer wider functionality across the client's business activities .\u201d \n\nFinally, a majority of respondents who expressed a view, considered that there exists a separate product market for CXM BPO services. One competitor respondent even stated that \u201c CXM BPO services are not comparable to IT services. Although it has an IT element to it this is in a supporting and enabling role and is not the main driver of focus of CXM services.\u201d Some customer respondents explained that managing a customer contact centre is a specific line of business, requiring specific business capabilities, which only partially overlap with the business capabilities / competences to run other outsourced services (such as IT support/maintenance, financial management)."

The respondents set out that it could only be viable if the operator has its own passive network close to the area where it uses active services and at the same time, it could serve/reach a certain level of customer density and access to passive services would be available. Moreover, some participants mentioned high switching costs , especially in case of migrating between wholesale service providers (e.g. de-activation and activation fees) and time needed for network deployment on the part of the access seeker (indicated to be from several months to more than a year).

The respondents highlight that operators would lose their investment (capex) in own active equipment as the sunk costs would not be recovered when using wholesale active access services instead. Furthermore, in such a case, the operators would face higher operational costs (opex) of active services as well as losing a possibility to differentiate more their services from that of the wholesale service provider as in case of using passive access services with own active equipment. In essence, it would go against the principle of the \u201cladder of investment\u201d. In addition, most market participants suggest there are regulatory differences between access to active and passive services. For example, the respondents state that at the time of their reply, there was no access obligation for TIM to provide FTTH passive wholesale access products (except in PNRR areas), while there was an access obligation to provide active services and those services were subject to cost orientation regulation."

The market investigation strongly supports that there is no demand side substitutability between lactase and other enzymes as the large majority of responding customers and of competitors consider that it is not possible to substitute lactase with another enzyme. As explained by a respondent: \u201cenzymatic activities are highly specific and unique to a substrate. Lactases specifically convert Lactose to Galactose and Glucose, on this basis the same enzymatic process could not be achieved using an alternative enzyme\u201d.\nThat is supported by a number of elements indicating limited supply side substitutability. In order to produce lactase, a manufacturer needs to have the relevant technology (a lactase enzyme and production host), the manufacturing capacities, distribution network and regulatory approvals required to manufacture and commercialise the product.\nAs a result, a majority of responding competitors and distributors consider it would take more than 2 years for a company already active in the manufacture of food and beverage enzymes to start producing and commercially supplying GM produced lactase and an investment \u201c between 10-50 million EUR if the company also has to build infrastructure and team; less than 10 million EUR if the company already has such resources \u201d. In all likelihood, given the similarities in the manufacturing process, similar investments would be necessary to start producing and commercially supplying non-GM produced lactase.\nAs a result, the Parties\u2019 argument on supply side substitution are only applicable to players that already have all the relevant technology, infrastructure, and approvals. Given the above, the Commission considers that there is a separate market for the manufacture of lactase."

Selection is most frequently driven by regulatory requirements to comply with organic certification, or company policy related to the use of GM derived ingredients/process aids \u201d.\nAccordingly, there are two types of lactase customers:\nCustomers bound to use non-GM produced lactase because they need a certain certification; for these customers, the Commission considers that there could be a market for non-GM produced lactase only. As the Parties do not overlap for non-GM produced lactase, this potential market is not considered further.\nCustomers that can use both GM produced and non-GM produced lactase interchangeably.\nThe Commission\u2019s investigation revealed that while this second group of customers can technically use either non-GM or GM produced lactase, there are indications that non-GM places a limited competitive constraint on GM."

Beyond that range, performance varies \u201d. A customer adds that : \u201cdespite their differences, you can compensate a low level of activity of a certain lactase by increasing the quantity used. However, using a higher quantity can impact the taste and texture of the product as well as the overall price \u201d.\nThis is supported by submissions of the Parties on the activity profile of various lactases at different temperatures and pH levels that show that the activity level indeed varies between lactases, with some performing better than others at a given temperature or pH. However, as confirmed by the Parties, that can be compensated by increasing the dosage of lactase used.\nOn this basis, the Commission considers that, with regard to end use, this is a market of heterogeneous products for which it is not appropriate to segment the market for lactase according to end use or performance level in different pH or temperature levels."

Not each factor was considered for each type of pharmaceuticals.\nThe market investigation has confirmed the Commission\u2019s decisional practice with respect to the product market definition of animal pharmaceuticals.\nIn particular, the vast majority of market participants responding to the market investigation agreed that: (i) animal pharmaceuticals form a product market distinct from animal biologicals and feed supplements, (ii) animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by different animal groups (CA, PA and possibly equine), and that animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by therapeutic areas.\nHowever, within a specific therapeutic area, various animal pharmaceuticals are not generally considered substitutable, as they are used for treatment of different indications. A veterinary pharmaceutical intended for a specific indication generally cannot be used for treatment of a different indication. For example, a Dechra product used for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s disease would not be substitutable with a treatment for Addison\u2019s disease even though both treatments belong to the field of endocrinology. Therefore, there is not always demand -side substitution for the various pharmaceuticals within a given therapeutic area.\nIn addition, market participants confirm that players active in an individual therapeutic area typically do not offer an entire portfolio of products in that area , and thus the competitive landscape for different indications even within a therapeutic area can differ considerably. Supply -side substitution is thus not immediate between various pharmaceuticals belonging to a given therapeutic area.\nIn view of the above, for the purposes of this decision, the Commission considers it appropriate with respect to the assessment of vertical links between the Parties, to use the markets for animal pharmaceuticals across therapeutic areas as a starting point for the identification of affected markets but has based the more detailed assessment on the upstream markets for animal pharmaceuticals for each individual indication and/or for a specific animal group. Further differences between animal pharmaceuticals for a specific indication or animal group (which have an influence on the pool of available alternatives) based on the factors identified in paragraph (15) above, are taken into account in the Commission\u2019s competitive assessment."

Although some treatments can only be offered by larger clinics (which can be referred to as animal hospitals), this does not undermine the fact that there is direct competition across the range of veterinary clinics, individual veterinarians and \u201cone vet clinics\u201d.\nIt is not appropriate to distinguish the provision of veterinary clinics depending on the type of animal (CA, FA or equine) for the purposes of the current case (even though there may be variations depending on geographic location). This is because all veterinarians can offer their services regardless of the type of animal.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party states that the product market definition can be left open as the Transaction would not give rise to competition concerns under any plausible market definition."

        "topic": "Veterinary clinics geographic market definition",
        "text": "The Commission has not in the past assessed the geographic delineation of the market for the provision of veterinary clinics. In a previous case, while not defining such a market, the Commission recognised that the retail of dietetic pet food via the veterinary channel could be national in scope or even local.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest that the geographic scope for the provision of veterinary services could be defined as local if the closeness of competition between providers of veterinary services were to be examined. It, however, notes that for the purposes of the Transaction, its effects should be assessed at a national level for veterinary services. This is because the Transaction gives rise to a vertical link between Dechra and IVCE, where the former predominantly distributes its pharmaceuticals through national wholesalers. The Notifying Party therefore does not believe it is appropriate to assess the Transaction based on a narrower geographic delineation.\nThe market investigation suggests that the provision of veterinary services could be either national in scope or local, depending on the type of clinic. As regards primary care clinics, most respondents to the market investigation considered that an animal owner would be willing to travel a distance of maximum 20km. As regards referral clinics, nearly all of the respondents consider that animal owners would travel at least around 50km to a referral clinics, with most of them suggesting that animal owners would travel above 200km. Some market participants explain for exa mple: \u201cFor more advanced procedures carried out in referral clinics, [\u2026], customers might travel across all of Finland for one specific clinic\u201d, and \u201cwhen a referral takes places, the pet owners are willing to travel very far to see the specialist (this could include long distances by car, and even taking flights)\u201d.\nGiven that the Transaction gives rise to vertical links only, and that the procurement of animal pharmaceuticals is in general managed by distributors and clinics on a national basis . This is supported by the fact that a majority of respondents to the market investigation considered that clinics generally have a purchasing strategy at national level, and even, bigger chains tend to have a multi -national / EEA -wide purchasing strategy with national components. Therefore, Dechra, or any animal pharmaceutical company, when dealing with veterinary clinics in a specific country, would typically negotiate the agreement with a centralised (at least) national procurement function of a specific clinic or groups of clinics. Therefore, any attempt of foreclosure strategy of the Merged Entity, i.e. preventing or worsening access to Dechra\u2019s pharmaceuticals, would have to be conducted on a national level. As a result, for the purposes of the vertical assessment in this case, the Commission considers it appropriate to carry out its assessment at a national level."

Furthermore, they argue that the Commission may leave open the ques tion of whether the following segmentations may be appropriate:\nSegmentation according to the type of production process used, between grey, blue, and green hydrogen.

The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, but argue that at least low -carbon and renewable hydrogen are part of the same market because (i) the production processes are similar (the key difference being the source of the electricity used), (ii) preference of customers, especially in the mobility sector, for low -carbon and renewable hydrogen, as a way to decarbonise the sector, and (iii) the fact that most hydrogen suppliers will be offering a mix of both low -carbon and renewable hydrogen to their customers in the coming years.\nSegmentation according to the hydrogen\u2019s application or end use, betwee n hydrogen used in industrial applications, energy sector, and mobility. The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, noting however (i) the nascent nature of the new decarbonised hydrogen uses and (ii) the role that blue and green hydrogen are intended to play in the decarbonisation efforts in the mobility sector."

Most of the surveyed hydrogen customers replied that both types of hydrogen are substitutable because both have the same composition, characteristics, and limited or no CO2 emissions. However, some respondents point ed out that , because green hydrogen does not directly emit CO 2, contrary to blue hydrogen, public subsidies are typically granted for the production and supply of green hydrogen and, moreover, customers increasingly prefer to source this type of hydrogen instead of blue hydrogen. One hydrogen supplier participating in the Commission\u2019s investigation qualified blue hydrogen a s a \u2018temporary solution\u2019 with \u2018 no long- term future \u2019. The Commission\u2019s investigation is also inconclusive on the need to distinguish between low -carbon and renewable hydrogen. Considering, however, the similar composition and characteristics of both types of decarbonised hydroge n, the fact that both emit limited or no CO2 emissions, as well as the small dimension and nascent character of the market for both types of decarbonised hydrogen, the Commission considers that there are currently no robust indications that the de carbonise d hydrogen market should be segment ed between (i) green and blue hydrogen or (ii) low -carbon and renewable hydrogen."

Most hydrogen suppliers, however, consider that no segmentation is warranted, as the composition of the hydrogen is the same and there are no reasons, from a technical, quality, production, or logistics perspective, to ju stify the identification of separate markets based on different end uses. In any event, as described in paragraphs (24) and (25), the mobility sector represents insignificant volumes of the total hydrogen demand in the EU. Because of that , as well as the fact that , from a technical and quality perspective, there are no major differences in the technical composition of hydrogen for different end uses, the Commission considers that currently there are no robust indications that it is appropriate to segment these markets based on end uses."

The Commission notes however that there are several obstacles for light vehicles to use HRS designed to service HDV . Indeed, an HRS servicing HDV will mainly be equ ipped with 350- bar pumps while current models of light vehicles require 700- bar pumps. Moreover, HRS servicing HDV are likely (i) to be located closer to logistic hubs than to residential areas and urban centres , (ii) to have station layout s dedicated to H DV drivers ( in terms of , e.g., height and size of the canopies) , and (iii) to use HDV -specific refuelling dispenser technology.

        "text": "The Commission has not yet considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV.\nHowever, t he Commission has previously considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of motor fuels. In that context , contrary to the retail sale of motor fuel products for B2C customers which may take place both at a national and local level, sales to B2B customers are essentially national because fuel card s are issued for national consumption, with prices either set nationally or with a fixed reduction to the local price and covering a nation- wide network of petrol stations.\nThe Parties consider that, unlike the traditional fuel retail markets, which are l ocal in scope, in the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV competition exists between operators at an earlier point in time and at a European level, or at least national level , for the following reasons:\nFirst, competition between HRS operators does not take place at the refuelling location since there is no spontaneous decision- making by the truck driver during his or her journey. Instead, the journey of a hydrogen truck driver will be carefully planned with a clear idea from the onset on where and when to refill at a n HRS. Competition between HRS offerings takes place at an earlier stage, when transporters compare available solutions and enter into a contract with a n HRS operator (either at project developer stage, or when already operational), when it is in the process of transitioning its fleet to hydrogen and needs to be reassured about the viability of the network for its trucks, or when it has already transitioned its fleet to hydrogen.\nSecond, B2B customers travel large distances intern ationally with HDV on a larger fuel autonomy. These vehicles typically have a range of 500 to 800 km with the technology currently available, and several HDV manufacturers are hoping to increase this range beyond 1000 km by 2030. Liquefied hydrogen technol ogy, which is currently under consideration for 2026/2027, could contribute to extending truck autonomy beyond 1000 km. As a result, a network of HRS for HDV could be spread over a large area and across multiple countries.\nThird, the JV\u2019s main customers will be major stakeholders with Europe -wide needs. [\u2026]. As a result, these international customers negotiate conditions at a supra -national level with international retail operators, [\u2026]."

The market investigation showed that transporters do not generally spontaneously decide to refuel. When asked to explain, respondents noted \u2018 the limited number of stations available today \u2019.

In some cases, it has assessed the impact on the markets for trading and clearing derivatives together, but in other more recent decisions has considered them separately.\nAs regards commodi ty derivatives, the Commission considered a distinction between trading services provided for soft and hard commodity derivatives, as well as even narrower definitions based on the underlying asset such as cocoa derivatives, coffee derivatives or sugar der ivatives. It has not previously assessed how this would apply to power derivatives.\nIn previous decisions specifically relating to the operation of trading platforms for power derivatives, the Commission has found that services facilitating the spot (i.e. short -term, physical) trading of electricity is a separate product market, distinct from services facilitating the financial (i.e. long -term, derivative) trading of electricity.\nRegarding execution environment, the Commission has not assessed in detail the scope of the relevant product market for services facilitating the financial trading of electricity, though it noted that brokers\u2019 activities (i.e. OTC bilateral trades) could potentially be included in this market, while leaving this question open.\nRegarding type of contract, in its previous decisions relating to the operation of trading platforms for power derivatives, the Commission has not previously considered whether the relevant product market should be segmented by type of contract. H owever, it has considered this question while assessing the trading (by customers of the platforms such as energy generators or traders) of power derivatives in the Nordics.

Consequently, when applying a literal interpretation of the concepts used in the Commitments, the appropriate use of the Slots should be understood as the absence of Misuse of these Slots.\nMisuse is defined in Clause 1.3 .5 of the Commitments, w hile \u201c appropriate use \u201d is not defined. The existence of a definition of \" Misuse \" and the absence of a definition of \" appropriate use \" in the Commitments points towards a  correlation between \" appropriate use \" and \" absence of Misuse \". Since Misuse of the Slots is deemed to arise under a number of circumstances listed in Clause 1.3 .5, a situation which does not give rise to Misuse can , a contrario, be considered as \u201cappropriate use \u201d of the Slots.

        "text": "In its practice, the Commission has traditionally defined the relevant market for scheduled passenger air transport services on the basis of the \"point of origin/point of destination\" (\"O&D\") city-pair approach. Such a market definition reflects the demand-side perspective whereby passengers consider all possible alternatives of travelling from a city of origin to a city of destination, which they do not consider substitutable to a different city-pair. As a result, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination is considered a separate market. In the past, the Commission has also taken into consideration supply-side elements such as network competition between airlines based on the hub and spoke structure of traditional carriers. However, the Commission considered that the degree of supply-side substitutability between different O&Ds remains limited. It considered in this respect that, although from a supply-side perspective a network carrier could in theory fly from any point of origin to any point of destination, in practice network carriers build their network and decide to fly almost exclusively on routes connecting to their hubs.\n In line with the Commission's notice on market definition, the Commission has given pre-eminence to demand-side substitution, whereby it considered that customers still need the transportation from one point to another and that competition still takes place on an O&D city-pair basis (even though some customers, in particular corporate customers, may have concluded corporate agreements for a range of routes and the commercial advantages stemming from such agreements may lead them to prefer one airline among the different airlines that operate on the route). It has thus traditionally upheld the O&D approach."

Traditionally these two groups of passengers have been labelled as time sensitive (\"TS\") and non-time sensitive (\"NTS\") passengers, respectively.\n In light of the above, the effects of the Transaction will be assessed on the narrowest possible markets, namely on a market for TS passengers and on a market for NTS passengers."

The Commission has sometimes distinguished mid-haul routes, which are routes of more than three hours where direct flights normally do not provide the option of one-day return trips, so that indirect flights may be able to compete with direct flights. With respect to long-haul routes (more than 6 hours flight duration), the Commission has considered in the past that indirect flights constitute a competitive alternative to direct services under certain conditions (for example if they are marketed as connecting flights on the O&D pair in the computer reservation system).\n The question of the substitutability of direct and indirect flights, which is relevant for flights from London to Riyadh and Jeddah, will be examined in the competitive assessment of these routes."

Specifically, the majority of competitors who responded to the market investigation indicated that short -liners do not exercise any competitive pressure on full -liners in Italy and that their presence is rather limited. One competitor, for instance, stated \u201cThere are not significant short -liners in Italy \u201d. Consistently, the majority of customers who responded to the market investigation indicated that , out of their total supplies, short -liners account for only between 0-5% for Rx products and for less than 5% for OTC and other products.

        "text": "The Commission notes that, in its past decisional practice, it has defined a product market for pharmaceutical wholesaling separate from direct deliveries performed by manu facturers. The market investigation results confirm the Commission\u2019s past practice. The market inve stigation feedback indicates that in Italy direct deliveries are particularly present in relation to certain products, such as generics, OTC, and other products, while they exercise much less pressure for the delivery of branded Rx products. This would be mirrored in the data submitted by the Notifying Party, which show that, by value, the share of direct sales for Rx products corresponds to 13.8%, whereas the share of direct sales for OTC and para -pharmaceuticals corresponds to 39.3%. Competitors who respo nded to the market investigation evidenced that direct deliveries exercise pressure on wholesalers to the extent that they focus on the delivery of higher -margin products, such as OTC and para -pharmaceuticals, at lower costs, since manufacturers only perfo rm these d eliveries in bulk and less than once a week. On the contrary, competi tors stress that all full- line wholesalers must be able to supply at all times the entire list of pharmaceuticals, even the lower -margin products, and they have to deliver these products to their customers once per day, at the very least, while generally they offer two deliveries per day. The slight majority of customers who responded to the market investigation confirmed that their needs for Rx products are covered by direct deliveries for very limited portions, i.e. , less than 5%, whereas direct deliveries would represent approximately 30% of their sourcing needs in relation to other products, such as OTC and para -pharmaceuticals. Based on the market investigation results, the Commission observes that customers need to be supplied by wholesalers at least once a day and generally in Italy they are supplied twice a day. Pharmacies rely on having short -term access to the full range of products in order to have them available at all times , and only wholesalers are in a position to supply the full range of products to customers on short notice and regularly. Therefore, while direct deliveries may be considered as an out -of-market competitive constraint, they do not belong to the same product market of wholesaling activities as they cannot be considered as full substitutes to the service provided by wholesalers, namely because they do not provide pharmacies regularly and they generally do not supply the full r ange of products. In light of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the relevant product market should encompass only wholesaling activities and exclude direct deliveries from its scope."

Within the sweet biscuits market, the Commission considered further segmentations (i) between products which are branded (\u2018B\u2019) or have a private label (\u2018PL\u2019); (ii) by customer (retailers vs food-service channel \u2013 restaurants, hotels, fast-food outlets, schools, hospitals) by category (form \u2013 sandwiched/ plain; and taste \u2013 chocolate coated, filled ).

Second, there is no \u201cmust -stock\u201d product category from the retailers\u2019 perspective.

Although some sweet biscuit suppliers are active in both private label and branded products, they usually focus on one of these activities and not seldom, their presence in the branded products is via co-manufacturing arrangements with the brand holder. The majority of respondents to our market investigation that supply both private label and branded products, consider that it is difficult to switch from private label to branded products as this requires significant investments in the product lines but also in advertising (if they were to build a new brand and not enter into a co -manufacturing arrangement) ."

Within asset management for institutional clients, the Commission has also considered further sub-segmentation by active management (asset manager aims at outperforming a benchmark such as an index) and passive management (asset manager aims at replicating the performance of an index). Similarly, within asset management for retail clients, the Commission has considered further sub-segmentation by open retail funds (no restriction on the number of investors) and closed retail funds (tailored for a small group of investors).

        "text": "Firstly, the Commission notes that the sale to Dnata would lead to the reinforcement of the smallest of the firms currently operating in the FCO in -flight catering market , allow ing Dnata to compete more effectively against the Notifying Party . Indeed, Dnata currently has a market share of [10-20]% of the in -flight catering market at FCO . Given , as explained in paragraph 38 below, the limited demand for in-flight catering supply at Rome FCO and the declining trend of the market , the sale would strengthen Dnata\u2019s ability to compete with Gategroup at FCO in the future. \nIn particular, the severe deterioration of th e market situation at FCO , which was considerably exacerbated by the COVID -19 epidemic , has led to a n important overcapacity , likely to persist for the foreseeable future, intensifying the competitive situation between the remaining in -flight caterers, including Dnata , as confirmed by the Trustee . According to the Trustee, there is in fact currently no appreciable market at Rome FCO due to tremendous volume -reductions. The Notifying Party understand s that [\u2026]. The increased contract volume brought about by the FCO Divestment Business would thus [\u2026], which could lead to a more competitive market environment in the in-flight catering market at FCO . \nSecondly, the Commission observe s that the structure of demand for in-flight catering situation at FCO does not seem to be attractive for new entrants . Unlike at other airports in European capitals, no new entry other than Gategroup had occurred over the past five years. In the future, FCO is expected to increasingly miss out on long-haul routes and become more and more a low cost destination (which is often served with retail on board products instead of in -flight catering) , with the Notifying Party expecting it to rather function as a \u201cregional airport\u201d. The COVID -19 cr isis has further deteriorated the attractiveness of FCO. [\u2026], [\u2026]. After inquiring with [\u2026] potential purchasers on 18 September 2020 directly , the Commission comes to the conclusion that Dnata seems to indeed be the only realistic and credible purchaser for the FCO Divestment Business. \nNew entry is therefore highly unlikely at FCO , in view notably of the reduction of the total size of the market for in-flight catering services at FCO . This situation is unlikely to change in the short and medium term. The COVID -19 crisis has further deteriorated this market situation at FCO. It is thus unlikely that any new entrant would be interested in entering the FCO in -flight catering market and that it could run the FCO Divestment Business in a profitable way, particu larly in the current economic context."

Regarding the Belgian Divestment Business, according to the Reasoned Proposal, there will be no change to the market structure, which currently consists of two competitors (i.e. Newrest -Servair and LSG).

Interior lights are either comfort lights for reading or while entering the car or (LED) lights spread throughout the car as a design feature or to illuminate e.g. the glove department and as such serve different purposes.\u201d While customers do not consider it appropriate to further sub -segment the interior lighting market, some competitors highlight that there could be a further sub -segmentation by the purpose or the position of the light.\n\nThe Commission considers that for the purposes of this decision, the exact product market definition for interior lighting can be left open as the proposed Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement under any plausible market definition."

Upstream activities include the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Downstream activities encompass the marketing and distribution of refined fuel products . In previous cases, the Commission consistently distinguished three different levels of distribution, two of which occur at the wholesale level (i.e. (i) ex -refinery sales and (i i) non -retail sales) and a third which relates to retail sales (i.e. sales exclusively to end customers). At the wholesale level , the primary level of distribution, ex -refinery sales, typically includes the supply to wholesalers, traders or the internal w holesale arm of the refiners. The second level of distribution, non-retail sales , encompasses the supply to independent resellers or retailers not integrated upstream and to large industrial and commercial consumers by secondary means of transport (e.g., t rucks). At the wholesale and non -retail sales level, separate markets have been defined by fuel type due to their different characteristics, use and purchasers. Accordingly, at least the following markets within the first and second level s of wholesale distribution can be distinguished: supply of (i) diesel, (ii) gasoline, (iii) LPG, (iv) heavy fuel oil and (v) light fuel oil. The \u2018traditional\u2019 fuel segments also include their biofuel variant (e.g., the market segment for diesel also includes biodiesel, an d the market for LPG also includes bio LPG)."

In particular, the Notifying Parties argue that there will be limited demand -side substitutability between tradition al refined oil products such as LPG and rDME, essentially due to the required equipment conversion costs (necessary to switch from LPG use to rDME use) and the premium price of sustainable fuels such as rDME as opposed to cheaper traditional products inclu ding fossil LPG. The results of the market investigation generally confirmed that rDME might constitute a separate product market from those of traditional fuels. In particular, the majority of competitors responding to the market investigation agreed th at rDME prices would , when it starts to be commercialised , be substantially higher than the prices for t raditional refined oil products, that LPG equipment would need adaptation to be used with pure rDME (it is estimated that blended LPG with a maximum of 20% rDME would not entail the need to modify existing LPG equipment) , and that current LPG producers would not easily switch their production to rDME, given the \u201c different production technology and equipment required \u201d. Moreover, only a small minority of the respondents to the Commission\u2019s market investigation (two competitors) indicated that the market for LPG and other refined oil products should encompass rDME , whilst the vast majority stated that rDME should form a separate market (e.g. \u201c[\u2026] the cos t of modifications to switch from LPG or blended LPG to pure rDME mean that LPG or blended LPG and pure rDME are not directly substitutable. This suggests that pure rDME would form a distinct segment of the market \u201d); or they could not ascertain the exact p roduct segmentation at this stage given the prospective nature of rDME production in the EEA (e.g. \u201c we do not possess enough data at this time to determine LPG and pure rDME are capable of being freely substituted for each other \u201d)."

Brandy and whisky were further segmented according to origin: (i) for brandy, different markets were considered for Cognac and Armagnac; and (ii) for whisky different markets were considered for Scotch, Irish, US, Canadian.\nIn a previous case, the Commission also considered the possible existence of separate markets for the supply of spirits depending on whether they are on -trade (i.e: sales to hotels, bars, caf \u00e9s, etc) or off -trade (i.e: sales to the retail sector). However, the Commission ultimately concluded that this delineation would not change the competitive assessment as the transaction in question in that case would primarily concern off-trade, i.e. sales to wholesalers and large retailers.

As to sales channel, because Tannico is active essentially on the online sales channel , the Notifying Parties consider that the Proposed Transaction should be assessed only on the online segment since this is the narrowest segment should a segmentation between online and brick -and-mortar sales channels be considered. As to the type of beverage sold, the Notifying Parties consider that it is not relevant to segment the retail market by type of beverage, as retailers of wines and spirits typically offer a broad portfolio across the board of wines and spirits (as well as other alcoholic beverages, such as beer, cider, and ready -to-drink beverages ), and could easily shift their capacity/shelf space from one product offered in store towards another in reaction to price increases.\nThe results of the market investigation support the fact that retailers purchase the whole range of wines and spirits as all retailers that expressed a view explained that they purchase the whole range of wines and spirits. Indeed, the retailers aim to offer a broad selection of wines and spirits to the final consumer to maximise their revenues. For example, one retailer pointed out in the market investigation that \u2018Our product portfolio has 3000 wine references and 3000 spirits references \u2019. The Commission therefore considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, the market for retail encompasses all wines and spirits."

Furthermore, a distinction between unit -linked life insurance products on the one hand and non-unit -linked life insurance products on the other hand was considered as well , depending on the product and country in question. In M.4701 \u2013 Generali / PPF Insurance Business , the Commission looked at unit -linked savings and investment products. In M.8257 \u2013 NN Group / Delta Lloyd, the Commission discussed a separate market for unit -linked insurance for certain pension products and savings and investment products. In M.9796 \u2013 Uniqa / Axa, a plausible market for index-linked and unit -linked life insurance was assessed for Slovakia. In some cases, the Commission has considered additional segmentations of the life insurance sector, including based on national insurance classifications. However, from a supply- side perspective, the Commission has recognised that the conditions for the provision of life insurance covering different risk types are quite similar and most large insurance companies are active in several risk types, which suggests that many different types of life insurance could be included in the same relevant product market."

        "text": "The Commission has previously considered a segmentation of the relevant product market for the supply of coating resins by (i) delivery technology, (ii) chemistry and (iii) industrial application.  A segmentation by delivery technology distinguishes between the following categories of coating resins: (i) liquid resins that can be further segmented into solvent borne and waterborne resins, (ii) radiation curable resins (\u201cradcure\u201d) and (iii) powder resins. The Commission considered that liquid, radcure and powder resins differ from one another in terms of production process, the way they are applied to the substrate, the curing time, the residue they leave behind and their environmental friendliness and are not substitutable with one another and constitute separate markets.  A segmentation by chemistry distinguishes coating resins by reference to the base chemical compound of the resin. Common chemistries of coating resins include acrylics, alkyds, epoxies, polyurethanes and polyesters or hybrids thereof, comprising two or more such chemistries. Different base chemicals impart different performance characteristics to the coating, and the chemistry that a resin manufacturer and its customers choose is generally driven by the requirements of the coating\u2019s intended industrial application. By reference to the industrial application, the Commission has previously considered segmenting coating resins into: (i) Automotive OEM; (ii) Automotive refinish; (iii) Industrial Wood ; (iv) Coil and pre -coated metals; (v) Other Industrial uses; (vi) Marine; (vii) Special Purpose; (viii) Packaging; (ix) Architectural; and (x) Adjacent coating and non-coating applications While considering it appropriate to segment the market for coating applications by industrial applications as well, the Commission left the market open."

Siligom SAS will also maintain the existing framework agreements concluded between Glass Auto Service and insurance companies. Independent garages belonging to Siliglass will also benefit from these agreements, reinforcing the overall network. Siligom SAS will also take over all of Glass Auto Service\u2019s employees. Siligom SAS will provide all of the technical, administrative, commercial, communication and IT support services currently provided to Siliglass, to Glass Auto Service, thereby ensuring that Glass Auto Service benefits from a broad range of support services.\n\nThe Trustee considers that the proposed transaction is an opportunity for Siligom SAS to accelerate its development in the vehicle glass repair and replacement market where it has been active since 2020. It will enable Siliglass to benefit from framework agreements with insurers that currently work with Glass Auto Service. In addition, the Trustee notes that Glass Auto Service\u2019s network can be seen as complementary to that of Siliglass and will therefore enable Siligom SAS to reinforce its geographic footprint in vehicle glass repair. Through the combination of the two networks, Siligom SAS can strengthen its position in this glass repair market and increase its bargaining power with its suppliers.

According to the Notifying Party, vertical links are a common feature in the automotive repair sector that will not prevent competing insurers to work with Mondial Pare-Brise as evidenced by other examples of vertical integration in this sector. Moreover, the Notifying Party states that the market shares are limited on the respective markets, MACIF\u2019s estimated market share being [10-20]% and Mondial Pare- Brise\u2019s approximately [10 -20]%. As a result of these low market shares on the respective markets, the Notifying Party submits that there cannot be any input foreclosure for insurers, nor customer foreclosure for repairers."

Regarding the production of secondary cast aluminium, the marginal overlap is due to the fact that Aurea focuses exclusively on the production of cast aluminium while the Divestment Business focuses almost exclusively on the production of wrought aluminium (i.e. [\u2026]% of its 2021 total aluminium output). As a result, the Divestment Business has only a marginal production of secondary cast aluminium of less than [\u2026] leading to a small increment (below [0-5]%) in a market where Aurea\u2019s market share is already very limited (i.e. approx. [0-5]%)."

Copper and aluminium have better electrical conductivity characteristics than steel. Steel has much better resistance to heat. Second, the different metal types are not always offered by the same suppliers. As an example, the Target focuses on aluminium products and [80- 90]% of its sales volumes are accounted for by that metal, as explained in paragraph (9) above. In addition, some customers require only one type of metal. For example, a transport company may be using a large quantity of aluminium to produce, for example, trailers, and may not have a need for other types of metals.

More specifically, the Commission referred to the ATC3 level, where pharmaceuticals are grouped in terms of their therapeutic indications, i.e. their intended use, as the starting point for defining the relevant product market, since these groups of products generally have the same therapeutic indication and cannot be substituted by products belonging to other ATC 3 classes . However, the Commission has also recognised that it may be appropriate, to carry out analyses at the narrower classification level ATC4, or possibly at the level of groups of molecules or individual molecules. Relevant factors to take into account include therapeutic ( e.g. prescription only, or administration allowed only under medical supervision) or pharmacological criteria such as molecule class, formulation or mode of administration. The Notifying Parties submit that the product market definition can be left open because irrespective of the exact scope of the relevant product market, no competition concerns would arise.

Into-plane suppliers have direct access to the distribution infrastructure at the airports.\n\u2212 Throughputters, which supply aviation fuels to airline companies as well as to resellers, but do not own or control any fuelling infrastructure at the airports.\n\u2212 Resellers, which supply aviation fuel to various customers at the airport, usually acquiring the fuel at wingtip (i.e., once it has passed through the infrastructure of the airport and is readily available to be supplied to the end-customer).\nIn PKN Orlen/Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered separate product markets for (i) into-plane supply of aviation fuels by both suppliers and throughputters on the one hand, and (ii) into-plane supply of aviation fuels by resellers on the other.\nFurther, in that same case, the Commission considered that the into-plane supply of aviation gasoline is to be distinguished from the into-plane supply of jet fuel.

In PKN Orlen / Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered that on-motorway petrol stations (including those located on toll and non-toll motorways and expressways) likely constituted a distinct market segment in Poland, but ultimately left the exact market definition open."

The Parties understand that Pentair, based on internal estimates, assesses that it has a worldwide market share for commercial water filtration of approximat ely [10-20]% , and an EEA market share of around [10- 20]% . Moreover, water filtration systems are not required to operate commercial ice-making machines, are not integrated into the ice -making machines, and are installed as an add -on to improve water delive red to a variety of appliances on a mix -and match basis. As a result, while the water filtration systems are a complementary product, there is not a strong correlation between the demand for commercial ice machines and water filters. In the market for wate r filtration products, Pentair faces competition from rival suppliers such as Ecolab, 3M, Brita, Kinetico (formerly Selecto), BWT and Total Water. If it tried to engage in an input foreclosure strategy, the Divestiture Business\u2019s rival ice -making machine m anufacturers (and other consumers of filters for ice machines) would have a variety of alternative filter suppliers from which to buy. Therefore, the acquisition of the Divestment Business by Pentair does not risk giving rise to any anti-competitive effect s, as it will not increase market concentration, will not result in any vertical or conglomerate effects and specifically in market foreclosure concerns, and will not raise any other competitive risks regarding potential exchange of competitively sensitive  information."

Gas shippers are therefore induced to make greater use of short-term gas supplies for which storage is unnecessary. Moreover, throughout 2010 the limited difference in the market price of gas for the summer 2010 and winter 2010/2011 seasons provided little incentive for shippers to reserve storage capacity in which to stock gas over the summer of 20104. Storengy, the GDF subsidiary which manages storage sites, pointed to an unprecedented decline in the take-up of storage capacity for the 2010/2011 gas year5. In view of the above, the conclusion can be made that there are legitimate grounds for GDF Suez\u2019s request for the lifting of Commitment No 73. It should also be noted that GDF Suez accompanied its Final Request with commitments which are likely to ensure maximum success in the future sale of storage capacity, in particular with respect to the offer of multiannual capacity and the fixing of a ceiling for the reserve price."

        "text": "Demand for existing gas transmission capacity from France to Belgium (reverse flow capacity) is low at the Taisni\u00e8res interconnection point. Indeed it can be noted that over the past two years only a monthly average of 42% of reverse flow capacity was reserved and the monthly reservation rate never exceeded 58%. So existing reverse flow capacity is far from saturated by existing demand, which would seem to confirm that there is no market demand for an extension to capacity to take gas from France to Belgium from Taisni\u00e8res. The interruptible nature of the reverse flow capacity does not appear to be the cause for the low level of take-up since, to date, there has never been an interruption of the reverse flows. The physical throughput of gas has always been sufficient to allow for an uninterrupted reverse flow. It is therefore highly unlikely that the installation of a deodorisation plant that would give rise to firm capacity would significantly change demand for the transmission of gas from France to Belgium through Taisni\u00e8res."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s investigation indicates  that a separate market exists for the manufacture and supply of new vehicles to car rental companie s, without a need to further segment it .\n\nSeveral elements support this conclusion.\n\nFirst, a majority of respondents to the market investigation who expressed a view indicated  that vehicle sales to car rental companies are made at diffe rent prices and supply conditions (for example, buy-back or leasing arrangements) than those to end customers. For instance, one car rental company indicated that \u2018the conditions offered to car rental companies are very specific to the car rental industry  and, to our knowledge, not offered to other customers. Vehicles are supplied on the basis of buy-back or leasing agreements \u2019, one OEM responded that \u2018the conditions for the sale of vehicles to rental companies is completely different from those made to other customers\u2019, and another indicated that \u2018rebates & holding periods (in case of buy -back) for STR  [short -term rental]  are different from the other channels \u2019. One car rental company indicated  that \u2018the supply of vehicles to rental companies is a separate market from the supply of cars to other companies in particular due to the difference in pricing and further conditions \u2019. Indeed, car rental companies hold vehicles for a limited period of time, usually a few months, and tend to purchase them subject to buy-back agreements with OEMs under which vehicles are sold back to OEMs at a pre -defined price after a certain period of time. To a lesser extent car rental companies source vehicles under leasing arrangements or standard purchases. On the other hand, the  majority of car rental companies who  expressed an opinion with respect to the affected markets were of the view that suppliers other than OEMs such as leasing companies, new car dealers and used cars dealers can supply them with cars. However, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under the narrowest plausible market definition, there is no need to discuss a wider market definition.\n\nSecond, the range of vehicles  to be supplie d is negotiated between car rental companies and OEMs. A  majority of car rental companies who expressed a view in the market investigation indicate s that they purchase ranges of cars with some flexibility on the exact product mix, which is ultimately to a l arge extent determined by OEMs. Similarly, in the pre -notification interviews, one car rental company indicated that it \u2018typically informs the OEMs of the volume it wants to purchase, and the OEMs decide on the splits and models, and therefore ultimately on the car mix . By way of overview of the process, [the car rental company] specifies the number of units, the specification of such units e.g. fuel type, transmission type, the ratio between risk and buy -back and mix of vehicle type (small, medium, large vehicles). The relevant OEM engages with [the car rental company]  accordingly in respect of each of these criteria in the context of its vehicle production. Though the process is iterative, the OEM ultimately determines and controls what it can deliver to [the car rental company] , which outcomes inform [the car rental company] \u2019s comparable conversations with other OEMs and fleet strategy \u2019.\n\nThird, Volkswagen \u2019s internal documents analyse the supply of cars to the car rental companies separately from the supply of cars to other customers."

In particular, one broker explained that \u2018a rental company based in the airport building is certainly in competition with a provider outside an airport. The basis of the consideration here is that vehicles from providers located outside an airport can be significantly cheaper for the same service. To get to the offer, shuttle services from the airport to the station are used to pick up customers in front of the Airport Building. In this case, a reservation mus t already been made in advance (pre -booked business)\u2019.\n\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the question of whether the geographic scope of the market for short -term car rental services is national or local can be left open, as the Transaction would not ra ise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under either plausible market definition.\n\nThe Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction on short -term car rental services at national level and at local level, the latter defi ned as services provided either (i) at the airport (including both on- and off-airport services), or (ii) downtown."

In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed an opinion indicate s that the negotiations for the supply of cars take place on a country-by-country basis . Similarly, the Notifying Parties submit that for Volkswagen, \u2018the typical scope of negotiations and agreements with RaC [rental car] customers is national \u2019, and that the supply contracts of Volkswagen with rental car companies are also negotiated at national level .\n\nSecond, prices for the supply of cars to car rental companies differ between Member States. In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed opinion indicated that prices of the same cars differ between Member States . In particular, one car rental company explained that \u2018prices are negotiated on country level and can differ up to 10%. This is because the market conditions vary between the Member States, as do taxes and ancillary costs \u2019. Similarly, the Notifying Parties  explain that, for Volkswagen, [\u2026], different VAT regulations and different tax regimes apply across Member States. For Europcar, [\u2026].\n\nThird, the conditions of supply differ on a by-country-basis. In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed an opinion indicated that the conditions of supply of cars differ between Member States . In particular, one car rental company responded that \u2018discounts, buy back pric es, leasing instalments, reconditioning costs etc. can vary significantly from country to country \u2019. Similarly, the Notifying Parties submitted that [\u2026].\n\nFourth, a majority of car rental companies responding  to the market investigation indicated that  the fleet mixes supplied to their companies  differ on a country-basis. One respondent explained that \u2018customer demand (which is a key driver in determining fleet mixes) differs between Member States depending on various factors including (but not limited to): size and quality of roads, climate, demographic, brand preferences/loyalties, seasonality, business/leisure use etc. Model availability and infrastructure (e.g., for charging electric vehicles) may also vary between Member States \u2019.

The Notifying Party further agrees that a distinction should be made between mineral wools on the one hand and foams on the other hand since: (i) from a supply side perspective, production processes are very different; (ii) while mineral wools have better fire protection qualities, foams are better at handling moisture; and (iii) from a demand side perspective, such differing technical characteristics lead to differing use cases.

Light industrial properties, on the other hand, are generally understood to be smaller scale properties used for light manufacturing, assembly and storage purposes. The Commission has also considered that both logistics and light industrial properties can be further segmented by quality into prime and secondary properties. Prime properties are newer, modern properties that benefit from a good location and are generally fully let. Secondary properties, on the other hand, are older properties that may be located in less attractive areas and which are more likely to be vacant.

Furthermore, the Notifying Parties\u2019 share of the total number of Slovak bank branches and ATMs is roughly in line with their combined market share in retail banking and corporate banking. Therefore, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition for retail and corporate banking can be left open.

The differences relate to factors such as the size and quality of the accommodations, the choice of central facilities and activities offered in the parks and the general state of the park (new or renovated on the one hand or old on the other). Nevertheless, it seems that further segmenting the market for accommodation in holidays parks according to quality groups may not be appropriate. First, the interplay between the factors noted above leads to a wide spectrum of holidays parks on offer and there do not seem to be clear criteria by which holiday parks can be segmented into quality groups. There also seems to be a degree of substitutability between some of these factors. In addition, each operator may offer different levels of services between its own holiday parks. Indeed, the Parties and other holiday park operators in Germany offer a varying degree of services and central facilities between their parks that may categorise the same operator in different quality groups. Furthermore, with respect to \u2018four season holidays parks\u2019 referred to by the ACM in its Gran Dorado/Center Parcs decision of 2001, it seems that there have been developments in the market and today holiday parks may be open year-round even with limited offer of central facilities and services. Indeed, the Parties, in their internal documents, and market participants interviewed by the Commission refer to holiday parks as belonging to one market with differentiated offer rather than divided into separate markets according to quality of services."
