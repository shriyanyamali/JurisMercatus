        "text": "In past decisions, the Commission considered that each of the markets for the supply of cat food and dog food could be further segmented: (i) between dry food, wet food and snacks and (ii) between branded products and products for private labels at the wholesale level. However, the Commission considered that different quality categories of pet food were not deemed to form separate relevant product markets. The outcome of the market investigation in the present case confirmed the Commission\u2019s previous decisions. The results of the market investigation confirmed that dry food, wet food and snacks should be considered to belong to different product markets. On the demand side, dry food is less expensive and can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration, while wet food offers higher hydration and palatability particularly for pets with specific health needs or preferences. Snacks are generally used as treats, but do not provide a balanced nutrition and therefore cannot substitute dry or wet food. On the supply side, these products are manufactured on distinct production lines with entirely different technical processes and dedicated packaging. The results of the market investigation also confirmed the relevance of a segmentation between branded product and products for private labels at the wholesale level. On the demand side, these products address clearly distinct use cases for retailers: the formulation and packaging of products for private labels are customized to the specific retailer and are labelled with the retailer\u2019s own brand, while branded products feature the supplier\u2019s own brand and are made available to several retailers in the same format. On the supply side, although the same production lines can in principle be used to produce both branded products and products for private labels, the supply base in these two segments is significantly different. This is because the main suppliers of branded products (such as Mars and Nestl\u00e9) are large, sophisticated conglomerates focusing on the promotion of their own brands and are not active (or no longer active) in the supply of products for private labels. Conversely, producers for private labels are generally smaller in size. And even if some of them also offer a range of branded products, this offering is often rather marginal and in any case much smaller than the abovementioned branded suppliers. With respect to quality categories, the results of market investigation confirmed that, although consumers often have a preference for one or the other quality tier, these different categories exist in a continuum and respondents were not able to indicate clearcut criteria demarcating the boundaries of each segment. Moreover, most suppliers producing pet food of different quality categories do so on the same production lines with no or minor adjustments to the manufacturing process. Therefore, in line with its past decisions, in the present case the Commission assessed market shares for the supply of cat and dog food at wholesale level distinguishing between dry food, wet food and snacks and between branded and private label products."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s past decisions concluded that the relevant geographic market is national in scope for branded products and larger than national (and possibly EEA-wide) for private label product at the wholesale level. This difference stems from the fact that private label products are not advertised by their supplier, as any advertising for private label products is done by the retailer. Producers may therefore afford higher transport costs and still offer the product at competitive prices compared to the branded pet food. Therefore, manufacturers of private label can competitively sell such products throughout an extensive area, which is wider than national. Moreover, some international hypermarket chains tend to carry out their procurement policies for private label purchases in a context which is wider than national. In the present case, the large majority of responding suppliers indicated that their European plants are able to deliver their branded and private label products in most of the EU territory and even to other continents. The large majority of responding retailers similarly indicated that they are able to procure branded and private label products from producers located in most of the European territory. In any event, the geographic market can be left open, because the transaction does not raise any concerns even under the most conservative approach (i.e. assuming a national scope of the relevant markets)."

The market investigation in the present case confirmed this conclusion. From the point of view of the upstream producers (which is particularly relevant in this case), the different distribution channels are seen to a large extent as interchangeable, because producers supply the same products across channels with no or minor adjustments. Suppliers also explained that they are able to shift volumes among different channels in response to changes in market demand. Also from the point of view of downstream consumers, grocery and specialist outlets are seen as competing against each other and consumers often buy products in both channels. The Commission\u2019s precedent (dating back to more than 20 years ago) did not mention sales on online platforms. The market investigation in the present case showed that customers easily switch between online and brick-and-mortar shops and suppliers increasingly pursue omni-channel strategies that span both online and offline sales. The Commission therefore considers that the overall market for the retail of pet food also includes online sales."

These agreements thus provide the legal basis for a global integration of the companies\u2019 networks and commercial policies. Furthermore, the scope of and rationale for these agreements go beyond the bundle of routes between Germany and their respective home countries.

According to the majority of both customers and suppliers MCC is not, or only to a limited extent substitutable for other excipients (such as lactose), as MCC has unique chemical properties and substitutes such as lactose are often not substitutes as there is a trend to providing lactose-free formulas. The market investigation also indicates that there may be a segmentation between MCC for pharmaceutical and MCC for nutraceutical applications. On the one hand, MCC for pharmaceuticals may have a price premium that makes it uneconomical to use it in nutraceuticals. On the other hand, MCC for nutraceuticals can only be used in pharmaceuticals if it complies with a pharmacopoeia such as the European pharmacopoeia. While the production process for both types of MCC is similar, there is a stronger emphasis on quality control and consistent quality for MCC for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, there may be limited substitutability between MCC for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, but the results of the market investigation are not entirely conclusive on this point, as the production process for all types of MCC is similar and there is an overlap of certain grades being used for both applications, which speaks in favour of not segmenting the market by end-application."

Further, the market investigation supports a possible further segmentation of the FCU market according to: (i) intended use (i.e., residential vs non-residential FCUs), (ii) based on the number of tubes (i.e., FCUs with two tubes and FCUs with four tubes) and (iii) design (i.e. classical FCUs that are free standing on the floor and non-classical FCUs that are mounted in the wall or ceiling).

Size and capacity of FCUs are the most cited distinguishing factors, with residential FCUs normally being smaller in size and having a lower heating/cooling capacity than non-residential FCUs. In terms of capacity, some respondent suggested that residential FCUs could be < 8kW and non-residential FCUs > 8kW. It was also mentioned that FCUs for residential use are \u2018quieter\u2019, \u2018thinner\u2019 and with better aesthetics (having excellent finishes and being made by metal sheets rather than plastic). Internal documents of the Parties appear to support a segmentation based on intended use. In addition, a due diligence report refers to a \u2018residential ventilation segment\u2019.

The Commission has considered further potential segmentations within non-carbonated soft drinks (namely fruit juices, energy and sport drinks), but has ultimately left this question open.

In the present case, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition can be left open. If dilutables were part of the wider market of soft drink (either carbonated or not, depending on the beverage mixed with the dilutable), no affected markets would arise in relation to these products.

Accordingly, a maximum of 12 daily slot pairs (i.e. the corresponding departure and arrival slots) are available for all the Relevant City Pairs considered together and within that overall limit, a maximum of five daily slot pairs are available for the Identified Long-haul City Pairs and for the London-Nice city pair.\n\nPursuant to Clause 1.1.2 of the Commitments, the number of daily Frequencies available to operate a service on the Identified City Pairs was increased from the original five daily Frequencies to seven daily Frequencies as the two slot pairs provided by IAG to Transaero were returned to IAG at the end of IATA Summer Season 2015. Therefore, at the beginning of the IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, 14 daily slot pairs were available, including seven daily slot pairs for the Identified City Pairs.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, slot pairs were granted to Aeroflot to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2017, slot pairs were granted to Flybe Group Plc (\"Flybe\") for the operation of 25 weekly Frequencies (up to four daily Frequencies) on the London-Edinburgh route and 18 weekly Frequencies (up to three daily Frequencies) on the London-Aberdeen route. For IATA Summer Season 2018, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of one additional weekly Frequency on the London-Aberdeen route (on Sunday) and two additional weekly Frequencies on the London-Edinburgh route (one on Saturday and one on Sunday). Also for IATA Summer Season 2018, Aeroflot was awarded additional slot pairs to operate seven additional weekly Frequencies (one additional daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2019, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of seven weekly Frequencies (i.e. one daily Frequency) on the London-Edinburgh route. For IATA Summer Season 2020, the remaining slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of four additional daily Frequencies on weekdays and on Sunday on the London-Edinburgh route and five additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Edinburgh route; and two additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Aberdeen route.\n\nTherefore, following the Summer 2020 Slot Award Decision, no Slots remained available under Clause 1.1.1(b) of the Commitments.\n\nFollowing Flybe\u2019s entry into administration on 5 March 2020, IAG (via British Airways) served notices to terminate its slot release agreements with Flybe on 5 March 2020 and clawed back the Slots that had been made available and were operated by Flybe pursuant to the Commitments. In total, IAG clawed back slots allowing 84 weekly frequencies.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, the Commission adopted a decision pursuant to Clause 1.3.3 of the Commitments granting Grandfathering rights to Flybe with respect to the Slots granted to it in the Flybe Summer 2017 Slot Award Decision (\"the Flybe 2017 Slots\"; concerning 43 weekly Frequencies).\n\nGiven that (i) a total of 98 weekly Frequencies are to be made available pursuant to Clauses 1.1.1 and 1.1.2; (ii) 14 weekly Frequencies were granted to Aeroflot; and (iii) Flybe has been granted Grandfathering rights with respect to 43 weekly Frequencies, 41 weekly Frequencies remained.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2021/2022, slot pairs were granted to Saudi Arabian Airlines (\"Saudia\") to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Riyadh route. For IATA Summer Season 2022, no Slots were released to applicant airlines. For IATA Winter Season 2022/2023 slot pairs were granted to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air France to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Nice route.\n\nTherefore, for IATA Summer Season 2023, 27 weekly Frequencies are still available under Clause 1.1.1."

        "text": "The relevant product market comprises scheduled passenger air transport services. The analysis focuses on city-pair markets for flights to and from London Heathrow airport (\"Heathrow\"), which is recognised as a highly slot-constrained airport. The Commission\u2019s assessment concentrates on the routes identified within the Commitments, specifically including London -Aberdeen, London -Edinburgh, London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow. The Commitments distinguish between \"Identified UK City Pairs\" (London -Aberdeen and London -Edinburgh) and broader \"Identified City Pairs\" (the latter including the UK pairs as well as London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow). The geographic market is primarily defined narrowly, as flights operating to and from Heathrow only. This focus arises from the congestion and slot constraints at Heathrow, which is the central concern addressed by the Commitments. An analysis of wider markets, including London \"three\" (Heathrow, Gatwick, City) and London \"five\" airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, City, Luton, Stansted), was considered. However, the Commission\u2019s decision and remedies are aimed at addressing competition effects specifically at Heathrow, as highlighted in recital 58 of the Decision and in line with precedent decisions. The term \"London -Moscow\" is interpreted within the scope of the Commitments as Heathrow -Moscow, not encompassing Gatwick. While Gatwick services exist, they were not part of the competition concerns at the time of adoption of the Decision, and hence do not affect the scope of the committed slot releases. The Market Definition section therefore recognizes the relevant markets as scheduled passenger air transport services on the specified city-pairs operating out of Heathrow airport, on which the competitive dynamics and remedies are focused."

However, the results also indicate that the propulsion technologies used in each are fundamentally different.\nAs regards a potential distinction according to the sector in which FCSs are used, the results of the market investigation suggest that the market for the manufacture and supply of FCSs could be segmented according to different end -use applications (e.g., automotive, stationary applications, construction equipment, forklifts, trains, ships) . While some respondents indicate d that currently there may be a certain degree of supply -side substitutability, respondents also indicated that, as the market matures, the differences between FCSs for different applications will be greater.\nIn light of the above, for the purposes of th e present decision, the Commission considers that it can be left open whether the market for the supply of FCSs may be further segmented according to the sector in which FCSs may be used since the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compati bility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement , under any plausible product market definition.

        "text": "With respect of a possible distinction of CRM software solutions based on functionality , the market investigation indicated that there may be  a separate market for the CRM software functionality of customer service and support, whic h also corresponds to a distinction used by Kustomer itself, as well as in third party reports, such as Gartner. From a demand -side perspective, a strong majority of responding market participants (both CRM software providers and business customers) cons idered that CRM software with different functionalities are complementary rather than substitutable and that customer service and support CRM software is the only type of CRM software functionality that is substitutable for Kustomer\u2019s CRM software product . The majority of CRM providers that expressed a view considered it would not be technically possible (or at best only to a limited extent), nor would it be likely from a commercial perspective, for business customers to switch to other CRM software funct ionalities (i.e., other than customer service and support CRM software) in a scenario where the price of customer service and support CRM software increased. From a supply -side perspective, while larger CRM software providers may offer a range of differen t functionalities, smaller players (such as Kustomer) may only offer one or a limited number of functionalities. There was no clear consensus among CRM providers on the ability for a company specialised in other functionalities to start offering customer s ervice and support CRM software in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs . While in the Phase I market investigation, a  majority of respondents that expressed a view said that this  would not be possible in the short term and with out incurring significant investment costs, in the Phase II market investigation, the results were mixed, with several respondents indicating that it would depend on the CRM software provider\u2019s existing capabilities (e.g., existing technology and know -how). In light of the above , the Commission  concludes that, from a demand side perspective, there is a separate market for customer service and support CRM software. To the extent the market would be  wider than customer service and support CRM software, this would thus only be due to supply -side substitutability arguments (i.e., a CRM software provider offering another functionality starting to offer customer service and support CRM software). However , the Commission considers that any CRM software provider active in another segment wanting to start offering customer service and support CRM software would require B2C communication channels as an input, as customer service and support CRM by definition requires interaction with customers, and that the mere fact that some CRM software providers offer multiple functionalities does not establish full supply -side substitutability if starting to offer a different functionality cannot necessarily be done in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs."

There was no consensus between business customers that expressed a view on whether on- premises and cloud- based CRM software solutions are substitutable for one another. From a supply -side perspective, the majority of respondents that expressed a view considered that it would not be possible for a CRM software provider specialised in on -premises solutions to start offering cloud- based CRM solutions in the shor t term and without incurring significant investment costs. However, the market investigation also indicated that a majority of CRM software customers use cloud- based solutions, and most CRM software providers only or primarily offer cloud- based solutions. One market participant indicated that \u201c companies that specialized in on- premise s solutions have or are moving towards offering cloud- based solutions \u201d and a leading CRM software provider  confirmed that it \u201c offers only cloud- based solutions .\u201d The same is  true of Kustomer. Indeed, the majority of respondents that expressed a view also indicated that cloud -based CRM software solutions are either progressively replacing on- premises solutions, or have almost entirely done so. In light of the mixed market inv estigation results and the fact that the majority of the market already appears to be cloud -based/SaaS, the Commission considers that it is not necessary to segment the broader CRM software market or the narrower customer service and support CRM software m arket between SaaS/cloud based solutions on the one hand and on- premises solutions on the other hand. However, the precise segmentation can be left open as the Commission  considers that it is likely, and there is even a strong probability, that the  Transaction would significantly impede effective competition  in both an overall market for customer service and support CRM software and a potential segment for cloud- based customer service and support CRM software solutions (as well as on the broader CRM software solutions  market  and a potential segment for cloud- based CRM software solutions)."

Second, there is a difference in pricing conditions as consumer communications apps are mainly offered for free.

Furthermore, market participants have generally confirmed that prices for MDA are negotiated and set at national level . As one market participant explained, \u201c[w]e have separate agreements for each country. Suppliers have separate organisation in each country \u201d. The fact that these negotiations take place at a national level is fully reflected by the fact that there exist significant price differences between EEA countries . Internal data from the Parties show significant price variations among EEA countries, for similar MDA models. For example, for washing machines, internal data from the Target shows that prices among EEA countries can vary as much as [\u2026]% from the average price .

Thirdly, the market investigation has revealed (i) the importance of brands for the purchasing patterns of final customers and (ii) that brands have varying importance from country to country. For example, one market participant highlighted: \u201cMDA are long-lasting products (i.e., a life cycle of 10-20 years for MDA) and customers thus tend to turn more to brands which they know and trust \u201d. Furthermore, brand positioning is not homogeneous from country to country. Some brands have a higher positioning in some countries, while being much less important in other countries.

As one market participant explained, this segmentation is \u201crelevant because the solutions for each sub -market will in some cases vary from sub-market to sub -market .\u201d Another market participant considered that \u201c[t]his proposed subsegmentation is closer to the business. As an example, different segments have different regulations that impact directly in the quality and the cost o[f] the services. \u201d In contrast, a competitor considered that the segmentation is not warranted, since \u201c Clients expect BPO service providers to offer wider functionality across the client's business activities .\u201d \n\nFinally, a majority of respondents who expressed a view, considered that there exists a separate product market for CXM BPO services. One competitor respondent even stated that \u201c CXM BPO services are not comparable to IT services. Although it has an IT element to it this is in a supporting and enabling role and is not the main driver of focus of CXM services.\u201d Some customer respondents explained that managing a customer contact centre is a specific line of business, requiring specific business capabilities, which only partially overlap with the business capabilities / competences to run other outsourced services (such as IT support/maintenance, financial management)."

The respondents set out that it could only be viable if the operator has its own passive network close to the area where it uses active services and at the same time, it could serve/reach a certain level of customer density and access to passive services would be available. Moreover, some participants mentioned high switching costs , especially in case of migrating between wholesale service providers (e.g. de-activation and activation fees) and time needed for network deployment on the part of the access seeker (indicated to be from several months to more than a year).

The respondents highlight that operators would lose their investment (capex) in own active equipment as the sunk costs would not be recovered when using wholesale active access services instead. Furthermore, in such a case, the operators would face higher operational costs (opex) of active services as well as losing a possibility to differentiate more their services from that of the wholesale service provider as in case of using passive access services with own active equipment. In essence, it would go against the principle of the \u201cladder of investment\u201d. In addition, most market participants suggest there are regulatory differences between access to active and passive services. For example, the respondents state that at the time of their reply, there was no access obligation for TIM to provide FTTH passive wholesale access products (except in PNRR areas), while there was an access obligation to provide active services and those services were subject to cost orientation regulation."

The market investigation strongly supports that there is no demand side substitutability between lactase and other enzymes as the large majority of responding customers and of competitors consider that it is not possible to substitute lactase with another enzyme. As explained by a respondent: \u201cenzymatic activities are highly specific and unique to a substrate. Lactases specifically convert Lactose to Galactose and Glucose, on this basis the same enzymatic process could not be achieved using an alternative enzyme\u201d.\nThat is supported by a number of elements indicating limited supply side substitutability. In order to produce lactase, a manufacturer needs to have the relevant technology (a lactase enzyme and production host), the manufacturing capacities, distribution network and regulatory approvals required to manufacture and commercialise the product.\nAs a result, a majority of responding competitors and distributors consider it would take more than 2 years for a company already active in the manufacture of food and beverage enzymes to start producing and commercially supplying GM produced lactase and an investment \u201c between 10-50 million EUR if the company also has to build infrastructure and team; less than 10 million EUR if the company already has such resources \u201d. In all likelihood, given the similarities in the manufacturing process, similar investments would be necessary to start producing and commercially supplying non-GM produced lactase.\nAs a result, the Parties\u2019 argument on supply side substitution are only applicable to players that already have all the relevant technology, infrastructure, and approvals. Given the above, the Commission considers that there is a separate market for the manufacture of lactase."

Selection is most frequently driven by regulatory requirements to comply with organic certification, or company policy related to the use of GM derived ingredients/process aids \u201d.\nAccordingly, there are two types of lactase customers:\nCustomers bound to use non-GM produced lactase because they need a certain certification; for these customers, the Commission considers that there could be a market for non-GM produced lactase only. As the Parties do not overlap for non-GM produced lactase, this potential market is not considered further.\nCustomers that can use both GM produced and non-GM produced lactase interchangeably.\nThe Commission\u2019s investigation revealed that while this second group of customers can technically use either non-GM or GM produced lactase, there are indications that non-GM places a limited competitive constraint on GM."

Beyond that range, performance varies \u201d. A customer adds that : \u201cdespite their differences, you can compensate a low level of activity of a certain lactase by increasing the quantity used. However, using a higher quantity can impact the taste and texture of the product as well as the overall price \u201d.\nThis is supported by submissions of the Parties on the activity profile of various lactases at different temperatures and pH levels that show that the activity level indeed varies between lactases, with some performing better than others at a given temperature or pH. However, as confirmed by the Parties, that can be compensated by increasing the dosage of lactase used.\nOn this basis, the Commission considers that, with regard to end use, this is a market of heterogeneous products for which it is not appropriate to segment the market for lactase according to end use or performance level in different pH or temperature levels."

Not each factor was considered for each type of pharmaceuticals.\nThe market investigation has confirmed the Commission\u2019s decisional practice with respect to the product market definition of animal pharmaceuticals.\nIn particular, the vast majority of market participants responding to the market investigation agreed that: (i) animal pharmaceuticals form a product market distinct from animal biologicals and feed supplements, (ii) animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by different animal groups (CA, PA and possibly equine), and that animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by therapeutic areas.\nHowever, within a specific therapeutic area, various animal pharmaceuticals are not generally considered substitutable, as they are used for treatment of different indications. A veterinary pharmaceutical intended for a specific indication generally cannot be used for treatment of a different indication. For example, a Dechra product used for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s disease would not be substitutable with a treatment for Addison\u2019s disease even though both treatments belong to the field of endocrinology. Therefore, there is not always demand -side substitution for the various pharmaceuticals within a given therapeutic area.\nIn addition, market participants confirm that players active in an individual therapeutic area typically do not offer an entire portfolio of products in that area , and thus the competitive landscape for different indications even within a therapeutic area can differ considerably. Supply -side substitution is thus not immediate between various pharmaceuticals belonging to a given therapeutic area.\nIn view of the above, for the purposes of this decision, the Commission considers it appropriate with respect to the assessment of vertical links between the Parties, to use the markets for animal pharmaceuticals across therapeutic areas as a starting point for the identification of affected markets but has based the more detailed assessment on the upstream markets for animal pharmaceuticals for each individual indication and/or for a specific animal group. Further differences between animal pharmaceuticals for a specific indication or animal group (which have an influence on the pool of available alternatives) based on the factors identified in paragraph (15) above, are taken into account in the Commission\u2019s competitive assessment."

Although some treatments can only be offered by larger clinics (which can be referred to as animal hospitals), this does not undermine the fact that there is direct competition across the range of veterinary clinics, individual veterinarians and \u201cone vet clinics\u201d.\nIt is not appropriate to distinguish the provision of veterinary clinics depending on the type of animal (CA, FA or equine) for the purposes of the current case (even though there may be variations depending on geographic location). This is because all veterinarians can offer their services regardless of the type of animal.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party states that the product market definition can be left open as the Transaction would not give rise to competition concerns under any plausible market definition."

        "topic": "Veterinary clinics geographic market definition",
        "text": "The Commission has not in the past assessed the geographic delineation of the market for the provision of veterinary clinics. In a previous case, while not defining such a market, the Commission recognised that the retail of dietetic pet food via the veterinary channel could be national in scope or even local.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest that the geographic scope for the provision of veterinary services could be defined as local if the closeness of competition between providers of veterinary services were to be examined. It, however, notes that for the purposes of the Transaction, its effects should be assessed at a national level for veterinary services. This is because the Transaction gives rise to a vertical link between Dechra and IVCE, where the former predominantly distributes its pharmaceuticals through national wholesalers. The Notifying Party therefore does not believe it is appropriate to assess the Transaction based on a narrower geographic delineation.\nThe market investigation suggests that the provision of veterinary services could be either national in scope or local, depending on the type of clinic. As regards primary care clinics, most respondents to the market investigation considered that an animal owner would be willing to travel a distance of maximum 20km. As regards referral clinics, nearly all of the respondents consider that animal owners would travel at least around 50km to a referral clinics, with most of them suggesting that animal owners would travel above 200km. Some market participants explain for exa mple: \u201cFor more advanced procedures carried out in referral clinics, [\u2026], customers might travel across all of Finland for one specific clinic\u201d, and \u201cwhen a referral takes places, the pet owners are willing to travel very far to see the specialist (this could include long distances by car, and even taking flights)\u201d.\nGiven that the Transaction gives rise to vertical links only, and that the procurement of animal pharmaceuticals is in general managed by distributors and clinics on a national basis . This is supported by the fact that a majority of respondents to the market investigation considered that clinics generally have a purchasing strategy at national level, and even, bigger chains tend to have a multi -national / EEA -wide purchasing strategy with national components. Therefore, Dechra, or any animal pharmaceutical company, when dealing with veterinary clinics in a specific country, would typically negotiate the agreement with a centralised (at least) national procurement function of a specific clinic or groups of clinics. Therefore, any attempt of foreclosure strategy of the Merged Entity, i.e. preventing or worsening access to Dechra\u2019s pharmaceuticals, would have to be conducted on a national level. As a result, for the purposes of the vertical assessment in this case, the Commission considers it appropriate to carry out its assessment at a national level."

Furthermore, they argue that the Commission may leave open the ques tion of whether the following segmentations may be appropriate:\nSegmentation according to the type of production process used, between grey, blue, and green hydrogen.

The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, but argue that at least low -carbon and renewable hydrogen are part of the same market because (i) the production processes are similar (the key difference being the source of the electricity used), (ii) preference of customers, especially in the mobility sector, for low -carbon and renewable hydrogen, as a way to decarbonise the sector, and (iii) the fact that most hydrogen suppliers will be offering a mix of both low -carbon and renewable hydrogen to their customers in the coming years.\nSegmentation according to the hydrogen\u2019s application or end use, betwee n hydrogen used in industrial applications, energy sector, and mobility. The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, noting however (i) the nascent nature of the new decarbonised hydrogen uses and (ii) the role that blue and green hydrogen are intended to play in the decarbonisation efforts in the mobility sector."

Most of the surveyed hydrogen customers replied that both types of hydrogen are substitutable because both have the same composition, characteristics, and limited or no CO2 emissions. However, some respondents point ed out that , because green hydrogen does not directly emit CO 2, contrary to blue hydrogen, public subsidies are typically granted for the production and supply of green hydrogen and, moreover, customers increasingly prefer to source this type of hydrogen instead of blue hydrogen. One hydrogen supplier participating in the Commission\u2019s investigation qualified blue hydrogen a s a \u2018temporary solution\u2019 with \u2018 no long- term future \u2019. The Commission\u2019s investigation is also inconclusive on the need to distinguish between low -carbon and renewable hydrogen. Considering, however, the similar composition and characteristics of both types of decarbonised hydroge n, the fact that both emit limited or no CO2 emissions, as well as the small dimension and nascent character of the market for both types of decarbonised hydrogen, the Commission considers that there are currently no robust indications that the de carbonise d hydrogen market should be segment ed between (i) green and blue hydrogen or (ii) low -carbon and renewable hydrogen."

Most hydrogen suppliers, however, consider that no segmentation is warranted, as the composition of the hydrogen is the same and there are no reasons, from a technical, quality, production, or logistics perspective, to ju stify the identification of separate markets based on different end uses. In any event, as described in paragraphs (24) and (25), the mobility sector represents insignificant volumes of the total hydrogen demand in the EU. Because of that , as well as the fact that , from a technical and quality perspective, there are no major differences in the technical composition of hydrogen for different end uses, the Commission considers that currently there are no robust indications that it is appropriate to segment these markets based on end uses."

The Commission notes however that there are several obstacles for light vehicles to use HRS designed to service HDV . Indeed, an HRS servicing HDV will mainly be equ ipped with 350- bar pumps while current models of light vehicles require 700- bar pumps. Moreover, HRS servicing HDV are likely (i) to be located closer to logistic hubs than to residential areas and urban centres , (ii) to have station layout s dedicated to H DV drivers ( in terms of , e.g., height and size of the canopies) , and (iii) to use HDV -specific refuelling dispenser technology.

        "text": "The Commission has not yet considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV.\nHowever, t he Commission has previously considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of motor fuels. In that context , contrary to the retail sale of motor fuel products for B2C customers which may take place both at a national and local level, sales to B2B customers are essentially national because fuel card s are issued for national consumption, with prices either set nationally or with a fixed reduction to the local price and covering a nation- wide network of petrol stations.\nThe Parties consider that, unlike the traditional fuel retail markets, which are l ocal in scope, in the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV competition exists between operators at an earlier point in time and at a European level, or at least national level , for the following reasons:\nFirst, competition between HRS operators does not take place at the refuelling location since there is no spontaneous decision- making by the truck driver during his or her journey. Instead, the journey of a hydrogen truck driver will be carefully planned with a clear idea from the onset on where and when to refill at a n HRS. Competition between HRS offerings takes place at an earlier stage, when transporters compare available solutions and enter into a contract with a n HRS operator (either at project developer stage, or when already operational), when it is in the process of transitioning its fleet to hydrogen and needs to be reassured about the viability of the network for its trucks, or when it has already transitioned its fleet to hydrogen.\nSecond, B2B customers travel large distances intern ationally with HDV on a larger fuel autonomy. These vehicles typically have a range of 500 to 800 km with the technology currently available, and several HDV manufacturers are hoping to increase this range beyond 1000 km by 2030. Liquefied hydrogen technol ogy, which is currently under consideration for 2026/2027, could contribute to extending truck autonomy beyond 1000 km. As a result, a network of HRS for HDV could be spread over a large area and across multiple countries.\nThird, the JV\u2019s main customers will be major stakeholders with Europe -wide needs. [\u2026]. As a result, these international customers negotiate conditions at a supra -national level with international retail operators, [\u2026]."

The market investigation showed that transporters do not generally spontaneously decide to refuel. When asked to explain, respondents noted \u2018 the limited number of stations available today \u2019.

In some cases, it has assessed the impact on the markets for trading and clearing derivatives together, but in other more recent decisions has considered them separately.\nAs regards commodi ty derivatives, the Commission considered a distinction between trading services provided for soft and hard commodity derivatives, as well as even narrower definitions based on the underlying asset such as cocoa derivatives, coffee derivatives or sugar der ivatives. It has not previously assessed how this would apply to power derivatives.\nIn previous decisions specifically relating to the operation of trading platforms for power derivatives, the Commission has found that services facilitating the spot (i.e. short -term, physical) trading of electricity is a separate product market, distinct from services facilitating the financial (i.e. long -term, derivative) trading of electricity.\nRegarding execution environment, the Commission has not assessed in detail the scope of the relevant product market for services facilitating the financial trading of electricity, though it noted that brokers\u2019 activities (i.e. OTC bilateral trades) could potentially be included in this market, while leaving this question open.\nRegarding type of contract, in its previous decisions relating to the operation of trading platforms for power derivatives, the Commission has not previously considered whether the relevant product market should be segmented by type of contract. H owever, it has considered this question while assessing the trading (by customers of the platforms such as energy generators or traders) of power derivatives in the Nordics.

Consequently, when applying a literal interpretation of the concepts used in the Commitments, the appropriate use of the Slots should be understood as the absence of Misuse of these Slots.\nMisuse is defined in Clause 1.3 .5 of the Commitments, w hile \u201c appropriate use \u201d is not defined. The existence of a definition of \" Misuse \" and the absence of a definition of \" appropriate use \" in the Commitments points towards a  correlation between \" appropriate use \" and \" absence of Misuse \". Since Misuse of the Slots is deemed to arise under a number of circumstances listed in Clause 1.3 .5, a situation which does not give rise to Misuse can , a contrario, be considered as \u201cappropriate use \u201d of the Slots.

        "text": "In its practice, the Commission has traditionally defined the relevant market for scheduled passenger air transport services on the basis of the \"point of origin/point of destination\" (\"O&D\") city-pair approach. Such a market definition reflects the demand-side perspective whereby passengers consider all possible alternatives of travelling from a city of origin to a city of destination, which they do not consider substitutable to a different city-pair. As a result, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination is considered a separate market. In the past, the Commission has also taken into consideration supply-side elements such as network competition between airlines based on the hub and spoke structure of traditional carriers. However, the Commission considered that the degree of supply-side substitutability between different O&Ds remains limited. It considered in this respect that, although from a supply-side perspective a network carrier could in theory fly from any point of origin to any point of destination, in practice network carriers build their network and decide to fly almost exclusively on routes connecting to their hubs.\n In line with the Commission's notice on market definition, the Commission has given pre-eminence to demand-side substitution, whereby it considered that customers still need the transportation from one point to another and that competition still takes place on an O&D city-pair basis (even though some customers, in particular corporate customers, may have concluded corporate agreements for a range of routes and the commercial advantages stemming from such agreements may lead them to prefer one airline among the different airlines that operate on the route). It has thus traditionally upheld the O&D approach."

Traditionally these two groups of passengers have been labelled as time sensitive (\"TS\") and non-time sensitive (\"NTS\") passengers, respectively.\n In light of the above, the effects of the Transaction will be assessed on the narrowest possible markets, namely on a market for TS passengers and on a market for NTS passengers."

The Commission has sometimes distinguished mid-haul routes, which are routes of more than three hours where direct flights normally do not provide the option of one-day return trips, so that indirect flights may be able to compete with direct flights. With respect to long-haul routes (more than 6 hours flight duration), the Commission has considered in the past that indirect flights constitute a competitive alternative to direct services under certain conditions (for example if they are marketed as connecting flights on the O&D pair in the computer reservation system).\n The question of the substitutability of direct and indirect flights, which is relevant for flights from London to Riyadh and Jeddah, will be examined in the competitive assessment of these routes."

Specifically, the majority of competitors who responded to the market investigation indicated that short -liners do not exercise any competitive pressure on full -liners in Italy and that their presence is rather limited. One competitor, for instance, stated \u201cThere are not significant short -liners in Italy \u201d. Consistently, the majority of customers who responded to the market investigation indicated that , out of their total supplies, short -liners account for only between 0-5% for Rx products and for less than 5% for OTC and other products.

        "text": "The Commission notes that, in its past decisional practice, it has defined a product market for pharmaceutical wholesaling separate from direct deliveries performed by manu facturers. The market investigation results confirm the Commission\u2019s past practice. The market inve stigation feedback indicates that in Italy direct deliveries are particularly present in relation to certain products, such as generics, OTC, and other products, while they exercise much less pressure for the delivery of branded Rx products. This would be mirrored in the data submitted by the Notifying Party, which show that, by value, the share of direct sales for Rx products corresponds to 13.8%, whereas the share of direct sales for OTC and para -pharmaceuticals corresponds to 39.3%. Competitors who respo nded to the market investigation evidenced that direct deliveries exercise pressure on wholesalers to the extent that they focus on the delivery of higher -margin products, such as OTC and para -pharmaceuticals, at lower costs, since manufacturers only perfo rm these d eliveries in bulk and less than once a week. On the contrary, competi tors stress that all full- line wholesalers must be able to supply at all times the entire list of pharmaceuticals, even the lower -margin products, and they have to deliver these products to their customers once per day, at the very least, while generally they offer two deliveries per day. The slight majority of customers who responded to the market investigation confirmed that their needs for Rx products are covered by direct deliveries for very limited portions, i.e. , less than 5%, whereas direct deliveries would represent approximately 30% of their sourcing needs in relation to other products, such as OTC and para -pharmaceuticals. Based on the market investigation results, the Commission observes that customers need to be supplied by wholesalers at least once a day and generally in Italy they are supplied twice a day. Pharmacies rely on having short -term access to the full range of products in order to have them available at all times , and only wholesalers are in a position to supply the full range of products to customers on short notice and regularly. Therefore, while direct deliveries may be considered as an out -of-market competitive constraint, they do not belong to the same product market of wholesaling activities as they cannot be considered as full substitutes to the service provided by wholesalers, namely because they do not provide pharmacies regularly and they generally do not supply the full r ange of products. In light of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the relevant product market should encompass only wholesaling activities and exclude direct deliveries from its scope."

Within the sweet biscuits market, the Commission considered further segmentations (i) between products which are branded (\u2018B\u2019) or have a private label (\u2018PL\u2019); (ii) by customer (retailers vs food-service channel \u2013 restaurants, hotels, fast-food outlets, schools, hospitals) by category (form \u2013 sandwiched/ plain; and taste \u2013 chocolate coated, filled ).

Second, there is no \u201cmust -stock\u201d product category from the retailers\u2019 perspective.

Although some sweet biscuit suppliers are active in both private label and branded products, they usually focus on one of these activities and not seldom, their presence in the branded products is via co-manufacturing arrangements with the brand holder. The majority of respondents to our market investigation that supply both private label and branded products, consider that it is difficult to switch from private label to branded products as this requires significant investments in the product lines but also in advertising (if they were to build a new brand and not enter into a co -manufacturing arrangement) ."

Within asset management for institutional clients, the Commission has also considered further sub-segmentation by active management (asset manager aims at outperforming a benchmark such as an index) and passive management (asset manager aims at replicating the performance of an index). Similarly, within asset management for retail clients, the Commission has considered further sub-segmentation by open retail funds (no restriction on the number of investors) and closed retail funds (tailored for a small group of investors).

        "text": "Firstly, the Commission notes that the sale to Dnata would lead to the reinforcement of the smallest of the firms currently operating in the FCO in -flight catering market , allow ing Dnata to compete more effectively against the Notifying Party . Indeed, Dnata currently has a market share of [10-20]% of the in -flight catering market at FCO . Given , as explained in paragraph 38 below, the limited demand for in-flight catering supply at Rome FCO and the declining trend of the market , the sale would strengthen Dnata\u2019s ability to compete with Gategroup at FCO in the future. \nIn particular, the severe deterioration of th e market situation at FCO , which was considerably exacerbated by the COVID -19 epidemic , has led to a n important overcapacity , likely to persist for the foreseeable future, intensifying the competitive situation between the remaining in -flight caterers, including Dnata , as confirmed by the Trustee . According to the Trustee, there is in fact currently no appreciable market at Rome FCO due to tremendous volume -reductions. The Notifying Party understand s that [\u2026]. The increased contract volume brought about by the FCO Divestment Business would thus [\u2026], which could lead to a more competitive market environment in the in-flight catering market at FCO . \nSecondly, the Commission observe s that the structure of demand for in-flight catering situation at FCO does not seem to be attractive for new entrants . Unlike at other airports in European capitals, no new entry other than Gategroup had occurred over the past five years. In the future, FCO is expected to increasingly miss out on long-haul routes and become more and more a low cost destination (which is often served with retail on board products instead of in -flight catering) , with the Notifying Party expecting it to rather function as a \u201cregional airport\u201d. The COVID -19 cr isis has further deteriorated the attractiveness of FCO. [\u2026], [\u2026]. After inquiring with [\u2026] potential purchasers on 18 September 2020 directly , the Commission comes to the conclusion that Dnata seems to indeed be the only realistic and credible purchaser for the FCO Divestment Business. \nNew entry is therefore highly unlikely at FCO , in view notably of the reduction of the total size of the market for in-flight catering services at FCO . This situation is unlikely to change in the short and medium term. The COVID -19 crisis has further deteriorated this market situation at FCO. It is thus unlikely that any new entrant would be interested in entering the FCO in -flight catering market and that it could run the FCO Divestment Business in a profitable way, particu larly in the current economic context."

Regarding the Belgian Divestment Business, according to the Reasoned Proposal, there will be no change to the market structure, which currently consists of two competitors (i.e. Newrest -Servair and LSG).

Interior lights are either comfort lights for reading or while entering the car or (LED) lights spread throughout the car as a design feature or to illuminate e.g. the glove department and as such serve different purposes.\u201d While customers do not consider it appropriate to further sub -segment the interior lighting market, some competitors highlight that there could be a further sub -segmentation by the purpose or the position of the light.\n\nThe Commission considers that for the purposes of this decision, the exact product market definition for interior lighting can be left open as the proposed Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement under any plausible market definition."

Upstream activities include the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Downstream activities encompass the marketing and distribution of refined fuel products . In previous cases, the Commission consistently distinguished three different levels of distribution, two of which occur at the wholesale level (i.e. (i) ex -refinery sales and (i i) non -retail sales) and a third which relates to retail sales (i.e. sales exclusively to end customers). At the wholesale level , the primary level of distribution, ex -refinery sales, typically includes the supply to wholesalers, traders or the internal w holesale arm of the refiners. The second level of distribution, non-retail sales , encompasses the supply to independent resellers or retailers not integrated upstream and to large industrial and commercial consumers by secondary means of transport (e.g., t rucks). At the wholesale and non -retail sales level, separate markets have been defined by fuel type due to their different characteristics, use and purchasers. Accordingly, at least the following markets within the first and second level s of wholesale distribution can be distinguished: supply of (i) diesel, (ii) gasoline, (iii) LPG, (iv) heavy fuel oil and (v) light fuel oil. The \u2018traditional\u2019 fuel segments also include their biofuel variant (e.g., the market segment for diesel also includes biodiesel, an d the market for LPG also includes bio LPG)."

In particular, the Notifying Parties argue that there will be limited demand -side substitutability between tradition al refined oil products such as LPG and rDME, essentially due to the required equipment conversion costs (necessary to switch from LPG use to rDME use) and the premium price of sustainable fuels such as rDME as opposed to cheaper traditional products inclu ding fossil LPG. The results of the market investigation generally confirmed that rDME might constitute a separate product market from those of traditional fuels. In particular, the majority of competitors responding to the market investigation agreed th at rDME prices would , when it starts to be commercialised , be substantially higher than the prices for t raditional refined oil products, that LPG equipment would need adaptation to be used with pure rDME (it is estimated that blended LPG with a maximum of 20% rDME would not entail the need to modify existing LPG equipment) , and that current LPG producers would not easily switch their production to rDME, given the \u201c different production technology and equipment required \u201d. Moreover, only a small minority of the respondents to the Commission\u2019s market investigation (two competitors) indicated that the market for LPG and other refined oil products should encompass rDME , whilst the vast majority stated that rDME should form a separate market (e.g. \u201c[\u2026] the cos t of modifications to switch from LPG or blended LPG to pure rDME mean that LPG or blended LPG and pure rDME are not directly substitutable. This suggests that pure rDME would form a distinct segment of the market \u201d); or they could not ascertain the exact p roduct segmentation at this stage given the prospective nature of rDME production in the EEA (e.g. \u201c we do not possess enough data at this time to determine LPG and pure rDME are capable of being freely substituted for each other \u201d)."

Brandy and whisky were further segmented according to origin: (i) for brandy, different markets were considered for Cognac and Armagnac; and (ii) for whisky different markets were considered for Scotch, Irish, US, Canadian.\nIn a previous case, the Commission also considered the possible existence of separate markets for the supply of spirits depending on whether they are on -trade (i.e: sales to hotels, bars, caf \u00e9s, etc) or off -trade (i.e: sales to the retail sector). However, the Commission ultimately concluded that this delineation would not change the competitive assessment as the transaction in question in that case would primarily concern off-trade, i.e. sales to wholesalers and large retailers.

As to sales channel, because Tannico is active essentially on the online sales channel , the Notifying Parties consider that the Proposed Transaction should be assessed only on the online segment since this is the narrowest segment should a segmentation between online and brick -and-mortar sales channels be considered. As to the type of beverage sold, the Notifying Parties consider that it is not relevant to segment the retail market by type of beverage, as retailers of wines and spirits typically offer a broad portfolio across the board of wines and spirits (as well as other alcoholic beverages, such as beer, cider, and ready -to-drink beverages ), and could easily shift their capacity/shelf space from one product offered in store towards another in reaction to price increases.\nThe results of the market investigation support the fact that retailers purchase the whole range of wines and spirits as all retailers that expressed a view explained that they purchase the whole range of wines and spirits. Indeed, the retailers aim to offer a broad selection of wines and spirits to the final consumer to maximise their revenues. For example, one retailer pointed out in the market investigation that \u2018Our product portfolio has 3000 wine references and 3000 spirits references \u2019. The Commission therefore considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, the market for retail encompasses all wines and spirits."

Furthermore, a distinction between unit -linked life insurance products on the one hand and non-unit -linked life insurance products on the other hand was considered as well , depending on the product and country in question. In M.4701 \u2013 Generali / PPF Insurance Business , the Commission looked at unit -linked savings and investment products. In M.8257 \u2013 NN Group / Delta Lloyd, the Commission discussed a separate market for unit -linked insurance for certain pension products and savings and investment products. In M.9796 \u2013 Uniqa / Axa, a plausible market for index-linked and unit -linked life insurance was assessed for Slovakia. In some cases, the Commission has considered additional segmentations of the life insurance sector, including based on national insurance classifications. However, from a supply- side perspective, the Commission has recognised that the conditions for the provision of life insurance covering different risk types are quite similar and most large insurance companies are active in several risk types, which suggests that many different types of life insurance could be included in the same relevant product market."

        "text": "The Commission has previously considered a segmentation of the relevant product market for the supply of coating resins by (i) delivery technology, (ii) chemistry and (iii) industrial application.  A segmentation by delivery technology distinguishes between the following categories of coating resins: (i) liquid resins that can be further segmented into solvent borne and waterborne resins, (ii) radiation curable resins (\u201cradcure\u201d) and (iii) powder resins. The Commission considered that liquid, radcure and powder resins differ from one another in terms of production process, the way they are applied to the substrate, the curing time, the residue they leave behind and their environmental friendliness and are not substitutable with one another and constitute separate markets.  A segmentation by chemistry distinguishes coating resins by reference to the base chemical compound of the resin. Common chemistries of coating resins include acrylics, alkyds, epoxies, polyurethanes and polyesters or hybrids thereof, comprising two or more such chemistries. Different base chemicals impart different performance characteristics to the coating, and the chemistry that a resin manufacturer and its customers choose is generally driven by the requirements of the coating\u2019s intended industrial application. By reference to the industrial application, the Commission has previously considered segmenting coating resins into: (i) Automotive OEM; (ii) Automotive refinish; (iii) Industrial Wood ; (iv) Coil and pre -coated metals; (v) Other Industrial uses; (vi) Marine; (vii) Special Purpose; (viii) Packaging; (ix) Architectural; and (x) Adjacent coating and non-coating applications While considering it appropriate to segment the market for coating applications by industrial applications as well, the Commission left the market open."

Siligom SAS will also maintain the existing framework agreements concluded between Glass Auto Service and insurance companies. Independent garages belonging to Siliglass will also benefit from these agreements, reinforcing the overall network. Siligom SAS will also take over all of Glass Auto Service\u2019s employees. Siligom SAS will provide all of the technical, administrative, commercial, communication and IT support services currently provided to Siliglass, to Glass Auto Service, thereby ensuring that Glass Auto Service benefits from a broad range of support services.\n\nThe Trustee considers that the proposed transaction is an opportunity for Siligom SAS to accelerate its development in the vehicle glass repair and replacement market where it has been active since 2020. It will enable Siliglass to benefit from framework agreements with insurers that currently work with Glass Auto Service. In addition, the Trustee notes that Glass Auto Service\u2019s network can be seen as complementary to that of Siliglass and will therefore enable Siligom SAS to reinforce its geographic footprint in vehicle glass repair. Through the combination of the two networks, Siligom SAS can strengthen its position in this glass repair market and increase its bargaining power with its suppliers.

According to the Notifying Party, vertical links are a common feature in the automotive repair sector that will not prevent competing insurers to work with Mondial Pare-Brise as evidenced by other examples of vertical integration in this sector. Moreover, the Notifying Party states that the market shares are limited on the respective markets, MACIF\u2019s estimated market share being [10-20]% and Mondial Pare- Brise\u2019s approximately [10 -20]%. As a result of these low market shares on the respective markets, the Notifying Party submits that there cannot be any input foreclosure for insurers, nor customer foreclosure for repairers."

Regarding the production of secondary cast aluminium, the marginal overlap is due to the fact that Aurea focuses exclusively on the production of cast aluminium while the Divestment Business focuses almost exclusively on the production of wrought aluminium (i.e. [\u2026]% of its 2021 total aluminium output). As a result, the Divestment Business has only a marginal production of secondary cast aluminium of less than [\u2026] leading to a small increment (below [0-5]%) in a market where Aurea\u2019s market share is already very limited (i.e. approx. [0-5]%)."

First, the different metal types have different applications and characteristics. For example, aluminium is significantly lighter than copper or steel. Copper and aluminium have better electrical conductivity characteristics than steel. Steel has much better resistance to heat. Second, the different metal types are not always offered by the same suppliers. As an example, the Target focuses on aluminium products and [80- 90]% of its sales volumes are accounted for by that metal, as explained in paragraph (9) above. In addition, some customers require only one type of metal. For example, a transport company may be using a large quantity of aluminium to produce, for example, trailers, and may not have a need for other types of metals.

More specifically, the Commission referred to the ATC3 level, where pharmaceuticals are grouped in terms of their therapeutic indications, i.e. their intended use, as the starting point for defining the relevant product market, since these groups of products generally have the same therapeutic indication and cannot be substituted by products belonging to other ATC 3 classes . However, the Commission has also recognised that it may be appropriate, to carry out analyses at the narrower classification level ATC4, or possibly at the level of groups of molecules or individual molecules. Relevant factors to take into account include therapeutic ( e.g. prescription only, or administration allowed only under medical supervision) or pharmacological criteria such as molecule class, formulation or mode of administration. The Notifying Parties submit that the product market definition can be left open because irrespective of the exact scope of the relevant product market, no competition concerns would arise.

Into-plane suppliers have direct access to the distribution infrastructure at the airports.\n\u2212 Throughputters, which supply aviation fuels to airline companies as well as to resellers, but do not own or control any fuelling infrastructure at the airports.\n\u2212 Resellers, which supply aviation fuel to various customers at the airport, usually acquiring the fuel at wingtip (i.e., once it has passed through the infrastructure of the airport and is readily available to be supplied to the end-customer).\nIn PKN Orlen/Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered separate product markets for (i) into-plane supply of aviation fuels by both suppliers and throughputters on the one hand, and (ii) into-plane supply of aviation fuels by resellers on the other.\nFurther, in that same case, the Commission considered that the into-plane supply of aviation gasoline is to be distinguished from the into-plane supply of jet fuel.

In PKN Orlen / Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered that on-motorway petrol stations (including those located on toll and non-toll motorways and expressways) likely constituted a distinct market segment in Poland, but ultimately left the exact market definition open."

The Parties understand that Pentair, based on internal estimates, assesses that it has a worldwide market share for commercial water filtration of approximat ely [10-20]% , and an EEA market share of around [10- 20]% . Moreover, water filtration systems are not required to operate commercial ice-making machines, are not integrated into the ice -making machines, and are installed as an add -on to improve water delive red to a variety of appliances on a mix -and match basis. As a result, while the water filtration systems are a complementary product, there is not a strong correlation between the demand for commercial ice machines and water filters. In the market for wate r filtration products, Pentair faces competition from rival suppliers such as Ecolab, 3M, Brita, Kinetico (formerly Selecto), BWT and Total Water. If it tried to engage in an input foreclosure strategy, the Divestiture Business\u2019s rival ice -making machine m anufacturers (and other consumers of filters for ice machines) would have a variety of alternative filter suppliers from which to buy. Therefore, the acquisition of the Divestment Business by Pentair does not risk giving rise to any anti-competitive effect s, as it will not increase market concentration, will not result in any vertical or conglomerate effects and specifically in market foreclosure concerns, and will not raise any other competitive risks regarding potential exchange of competitively sensitive  information."

Gas shippers are therefore induced to make greater use of short-term gas supplies for which storage is unnecessary. Moreover, throughout 2010 the limited difference in the market price of gas for the summer 2010 and winter 2010/2011 seasons provided little incentive for shippers to reserve storage capacity in which to stock gas over the summer of 20104. Storengy, the GDF subsidiary which manages storage sites, pointed to an unprecedented decline in the take-up of storage capacity for the 2010/2011 gas year5. In view of the above, the conclusion can be made that there are legitimate grounds for GDF Suez\u2019s request for the lifting of Commitment No 73. It should also be noted that GDF Suez accompanied its Final Request with commitments which are likely to ensure maximum success in the future sale of storage capacity, in particular with respect to the offer of multiannual capacity and the fixing of a ceiling for the reserve price."

        "text": "Demand for existing gas transmission capacity from France to Belgium (reverse flow capacity) is low at the Taisni\u00e8res interconnection point. Indeed it can be noted that over the past two years only a monthly average of 42% of reverse flow capacity was reserved and the monthly reservation rate never exceeded 58%. So existing reverse flow capacity is far from saturated by existing demand, which would seem to confirm that there is no market demand for an extension to capacity to take gas from France to Belgium from Taisni\u00e8res. The interruptible nature of the reverse flow capacity does not appear to be the cause for the low level of take-up since, to date, there has never been an interruption of the reverse flows. The physical throughput of gas has always been sufficient to allow for an uninterrupted reverse flow. It is therefore highly unlikely that the installation of a deodorisation plant that would give rise to firm capacity would significantly change demand for the transmission of gas from France to Belgium through Taisni\u00e8res."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s investigation indicates  that a separate market exists for the manufacture and supply of new vehicles to car rental companie s, without a need to further segment it .\n\nSeveral elements support this conclusion.\n\nFirst, a majority of respondents to the market investigation who expressed a view indicated  that vehicle sales to car rental companies are made at diffe rent prices and supply conditions (for example, buy-back or leasing arrangements) than those to end customers. For instance, one car rental company indicated that \u2018the conditions offered to car rental companies are very specific to the car rental industry  and, to our knowledge, not offered to other customers. Vehicles are supplied on the basis of buy-back or leasing agreements \u2019, one OEM responded that \u2018the conditions for the sale of vehicles to rental companies is completely different from those made to other customers\u2019, and another indicated that \u2018rebates & holding periods (in case of buy -back) for STR  [short -term rental]  are different from the other channels \u2019. One car rental company indicated  that \u2018the supply of vehicles to rental companies is a separate market from the supply of cars to other companies in particular due to the difference in pricing and further conditions \u2019. Indeed, car rental companies hold vehicles for a limited period of time, usually a few months, and tend to purchase them subject to buy-back agreements with OEMs under which vehicles are sold back to OEMs at a pre -defined price after a certain period of time. To a lesser extent car rental companies source vehicles under leasing arrangements or standard purchases. On the other hand, the  majority of car rental companies who  expressed an opinion with respect to the affected markets were of the view that suppliers other than OEMs such as leasing companies, new car dealers and used cars dealers can supply them with cars. However, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under the narrowest plausible market definition, there is no need to discuss a wider market definition.\n\nSecond, the range of vehicles  to be supplie d is negotiated between car rental companies and OEMs. A  majority of car rental companies who expressed a view in the market investigation indicate s that they purchase ranges of cars with some flexibility on the exact product mix, which is ultimately to a l arge extent determined by OEMs. Similarly, in the pre -notification interviews, one car rental company indicated that it \u2018typically informs the OEMs of the volume it wants to purchase, and the OEMs decide on the splits and models, and therefore ultimately on the car mix . By way of overview of the process, [the car rental company] specifies the number of units, the specification of such units e.g. fuel type, transmission type, the ratio between risk and buy -back and mix of vehicle type (small, medium, large vehicles). The relevant OEM engages with [the car rental company]  accordingly in respect of each of these criteria in the context of its vehicle production. Though the process is iterative, the OEM ultimately determines and controls what it can deliver to [the car rental company] , which outcomes inform [the car rental company] \u2019s comparable conversations with other OEMs and fleet strategy \u2019.\n\nThird, Volkswagen \u2019s internal documents analyse the supply of cars to the car rental companies separately from the supply of cars to other customers."

In particular, one broker explained that \u2018a rental company based in the airport building is certainly in competition with a provider outside an airport. The basis of the consideration here is that vehicles from providers located outside an airport can be significantly cheaper for the same service. To get to the offer, shuttle services from the airport to the station are used to pick up customers in front of the Airport Building. In this case, a reservation mus t already been made in advance (pre -booked business)\u2019.\n\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the question of whether the geographic scope of the market for short -term car rental services is national or local can be left open, as the Transaction would not ra ise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under either plausible market definition.\n\nThe Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction on short -term car rental services at national level and at local level, the latter defi ned as services provided either (i) at the airport (including both on- and off-airport services), or (ii) downtown."

In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed an opinion indicate s that the negotiations for the supply of cars take place on a country-by-country basis . Similarly, the Notifying Parties submit that for Volkswagen, \u2018the typical scope of negotiations and agreements with RaC [rental car] customers is national \u2019, and that the supply contracts of Volkswagen with rental car companies are also negotiated at national level .\n\nSecond, prices for the supply of cars to car rental companies differ between Member States. In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed opinion indicated that prices of the same cars differ between Member States . In particular, one car rental company explained that \u2018prices are negotiated on country level and can differ up to 10%. This is because the market conditions vary between the Member States, as do taxes and ancillary costs \u2019. Similarly, the Notifying Parties  explain that, for Volkswagen, [\u2026], different VAT regulations and different tax regimes apply across Member States. For Europcar, [\u2026].\n\nThird, the conditions of supply differ on a by-country-basis. In this respect, a majority of respondents to the market investigation having expressed an opinion indicated that the conditions of supply of cars differ between Member States . In particular, one car rental company responded that \u2018discounts, buy back pric es, leasing instalments, reconditioning costs etc. can vary significantly from country to country \u2019.

One respondent explained that \u2018customer demand (which is a key driver in determining fleet mixes) differs between Member States depending on various factors including (but not limited to): size and quality of roads, climate, demographic, brand preferences/loyalties, seasonality, business/leisure use etc. Model availability and infrastructure (e.g., for charging electric vehicles) may also vary between Member States \u2019.

The Notifying Party further agrees that a distinction should be made between mineral wools on the one hand and foams on the other hand since: (i) from a supply side perspective, production processes are very different; (ii) while mineral wools have better fire protection qualities, foams are better at handling moisture; and (iii) from a demand side perspective, such differing technical characteristics lead to differing use cases.

Light industrial properties, on the other hand, are generally understood to be smaller scale properties used for light manufacturing, assembly and storage purposes. The Commission has also considered that both logistics and light industrial properties can be further segmented by quality into prime and secondary properties. Prime properties are newer, modern properties that benefit from a good location and are generally fully let. Secondary properties, on the other hand, are older properties that may be located in less attractive areas and which are more likely to be vacant.

Furthermore, the Notifying Parties\u2019 share of the total number of Slovak bank branches and ATMs is roughly in line with their combined market share in retail banking and corporate banking. Therefore, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition for retail and corporate banking can be left open.

The differences relate to factors such as the size and quality of the accommodations, the choice of central facilities and activities offered in the parks and the general state of the park (new or renovated on the one hand or old on the other). Nevertheless, it seems that further segmenting the market for accommodation in holidays parks according to quality groups may not be appropriate. First, the interplay between the factors noted above leads to a wide spectrum of holidays parks on offer and there do not seem to be clear criteria by which holiday parks can be segmented into quality groups. There also seems to be a degree of substitutability between some of these factors. In addition, each operator may offer different levels of services between its own holiday parks. Indeed, the Parties and other holiday park operators in Germany offer a varying degree of services and central facilities between their parks that may categorise the same operator in different quality groups. Furthermore, with respect to \u2018four season holidays parks\u2019 referred to by the ACM in its Gran Dorado/Center Parcs decision of 2001, it seems that there have been developments in the market and today holiday parks may be open year-round even with limited offer of central facilities and services. Indeed, the Parties, in their internal documents, and market participants interviewed by the Commission refer to holiday parks as belonging to one market with differentiated offer rather than divided into separate markets according to quality of services."

Both repair and replacement lead to the same result for the customer, a fixed windscreen without the driver\u2019s view being impaired . The only difference consists of higher costs for replacement , as an insured motorist might have to pay an excess of EUR 50 -180.

Demand in this market is highly localised. Customers are unwilling to travel more than 30 or 45 minutes in order to have a windshield repaired or replaced, and insurers seek to offer their policy holders options as close to their home or place of work as possible. However, this means that to be competitive, repair networks need to be dense and cover the whole country. From a supply- side perspective however, it appears that the conditions of competition in this market are fairly homogeneous across metropolitan France. A majority of customers who responded consider that motorists tend to have similar alternatives wherever they are in metropolitan France, though a majority of competitors pointed to differences between rural and urban areas. All respondents confirmed that the main glass repair networks are active throughout the whole of metropolitan France. A large majority of respondents also confirmed that prices do not vary significantly across metropolitan France. For national networks of glass specialists which enter into framework agreements with insurers and fleet -owners, prices are usually set nationally, with some variation between the Parisian region and the rest of the country to account for differences in labour costs . The component of the price which reflects the cost of spare parts however does not vary."

In particular, Google Search can be considered to be an online HSH tool for those maths search queries that it directly answers, and can be considered a general search service for those maths search queries that it does not directly answer but instead for which it provides links to other online HSH tools. Regarding the demand -side perspective , the majority of respondents indicated that users consider other general learning and education solutions, in particular Google Workspace or Google Classroom, as substitutes for online HSH tools. However, the Commissions considers, that from a user\u2019s perspective, learning and education tools without a maths offering are not a reasonable alternative if the user wishes to solve maths homework or wants to improve his or her maths skills. The Commission considers that it can be left open whether the relevant product market should be broader, consisting of all online learning and education tools, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market regardless of whether such a broader product market is considered instead of online HSH tools that include a maths offering."

However, a majority of respondents to the market investigation indicated that users does not consider quiz -type tools as an alternative to first party content that provide instant maths solutions. However, the Commission considers at least for certain users, particular functions are so important that these users would not consider tools without the same functions as a credible alternative. For instance, for some maths problems that use symbols that are not available on normal keyboards, OCR functionality is a key feature. More over, students might need a step -by-step explanation to understand the problem and also to receive credits from their teacher when handing in the solution. Furthermore, time could also be an issue and, therefore , users might strongly prefer tools that provide an instant solution and therefore consider that a quiz and forum -only tool s are not an alternative to the first party tool providing instant solution. However , the Commission considers that the question of whether the market for the supply of online HSH tools that include a maths offering should be further segmented by excluding tools that are only a forum, without OCR functionality or without solution steps , or any combination thereof can be left open , as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible product market definition."

According to this approach, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination should be considered to be a separate market from the customer's viewpoint. To establish whether an O&D pair forms a relevant product market, the Commission considers the different possibilities offered to consumers to travel between these two points. The Commission will not only consider the direct flights between the two airports concerned, but also other transport alternatives to the extent that they are substitutable to these direct flights. These alternatives may include direct flights between other airports which have overlapping catchment areas with the airports concerned at each end (airport substitution), indirect flights between the airports concerned, or other means of transport such as road, train or sea (inter-modal substitution). Whether one of those alternatives is substitutable to the direct route depends on a multiplicity of factors, such as the overall travel time, frequency of services and the price of the different alternatives. This can only be decided on a route-by-route basis. The parties have accepted this approach. However, the parties also maintain that, from the supply side perspective, there are clear indications that airlines increasingly compete on a network-to-network basis."

Some competitors have suggested that this difference no longer reflect the requirements of passengers and the commercial policy of the airlines. However, customers and travel agents have confirmed the importance for certain travellers (mainly business passengers) to the possibility to modify their tickets and return as soon as possible to their point of origin, preferably within the day if a short-haul route (this requirement does not, obviously, exclude that these customers are also -more and more, as argued by many respondents - price-sensitive). Time-sensitive passengers have therefore different requirements than non-sensitive ones and normally will only choose to fly airlines offering a high number of frequencies in a given O&D pair and the possibility to use unrestricted tickets. Therefore, the Commission considers the existence of two distinct markets for time-sensitive and non time-sensitive passengers when assessing the proposed merger\u0092s impact on competition on the different routes."

This is the case of some of the routes affected by the present transaction where a significant number of time-sensitive passengers even prefer the indirect service over the direct one. This is due to the inadequacy of the direct flight to meet the specific requirements of time sensitive passengers, namely a high number of frequencies allowing the completion of a roundtrip in a day."

The Commission concluded that indirect flights may constitute a competitive alternative to non-stop services if they are marketed as connecting flights on the city pair on computer reservation systems, are operated on a daily basis and cause only a limited extension of the trip (150 minutes waiting time). In recent transatlantic alliance decisions, the Commission followed a similar approach and concluded that indirect flights, under certain conditions, appear to exert a sufficient competitive constraint on non-stop long haul services.

However, corporate customers are only one customer group and, according to the market investigation, probably the most time-sensitive one. Other customer groups can accept longer connection times. Moreover, other elements brought by the market investigation mitigate this suggestions since, on long haul routes, the dividing line between time sensitive passengers and non time sensitive passengers has become less clear. As was reported by several parties (including the merging parties themselves) an increasing number of time-sensitive passengers appear to have become more price sensitive. In particular an increasing number of undertakings require their employees to take the most economical flights, including indirect flights, irrespective of total flight duration or longer connecting times. It is therefore still considered that the availability of flights with a maximum connection time of 150 minutes exert sufficient competitive constraint on long-haul direct flights."

From the demand side, passengers who begin or end their journey in a catchment area of two or more airports can choose from and to which airport they wish to fly. This increases competition if the choice between airports also implies a wider choice between different airlines, to the extent that they are independent from each other (i.e. that they are not alliance partners or franchisees). To the extent that such areas exist, the share of customers on a certain route who actually live in an overlapping catchment area will have to be established. Only if the share of such passengers is sufficiently high, a carrier would take them into account when setting prices."

The special requirements of certain products relates mainly to activities ancillary to the cargo transport such as ground handling. Nevertheless, it appears that a limited number of products would require a specific type of carrier. For instance, certain oversized cargo and dangerous goods could not be transported by carriers transporting passengers, due to physical or legal constraints. Such services are therefore more likely provided by carriers operating full freight aircrafts. On the other hand, extremely time-sensitive products (such as perishables goods) would require a high number of frequencies and a better inter-connectivity, which normally only combination airlines (i.e. airlines combining the services of passengers and cargo) could guarantee."

        "topic": "Lead Sulphate Product Market Definition",
        "text": "The Commission has not previously defined the relevant product market for the supply of lead sulphate. The Notifying Party considers lead sulphate as a distinct product market and submits that no further segmentation would be relevant.\n\nIn this respect, the results of the investigations confirm the view that lead sulphate constitutes a separate market, distinct from other feedstock used for lead production.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, a distinction can be made between primary feedstock (i.e. lead concentrate) and secondary feedstock (i.e. lead sulphate and recycled materials). While primary feedstock generates heat when smelted, secondary feedstock and lead sulphate in particular consume heat when smelted. In this regard, the investigations confirmed that lead smelters are required to manage the heat balance of their lead smelting process, which limits demand substitutability between primary and secondary feedstock. This is also consistent with the Parties\u2019 internal documents.\n\nLikewise, demand substitutability between secondary feedstock (i.e. lead sulphate and recycled materials) appears limited. For instance, as one vertically integrated zinc smelter explained \u2018Secondary smelters only use materials derived from the recycling of batteries. These materials are very clean and consistent with high lead content and low impurities\u2019. As a result, secondary smelters cannot substitute lead sulphate for recycled materials and, conversely, primary smelters cannot substitute recycled materials for lead sulphate.\n\nThis is consistent with the results of the First Investigation, in which the majority of participants confirmed that switching from lead sulphate to other feedstock (including primary and other secondary feedstock) would require significant investments and considerable time for customers.\n\nFrom a supply perspective, lead sulphate, lead concentrate and scrap materials come from different sources and are supplied by different undertakings. In this respect, zinc smelters producing lead sulphate as a by-product are not able to produce metal concentrates (which are the result of mining operations) or metal scrap (which is produced by final users of metal products).\n\nWithin lead sulphate, the results of the investigations suggest that a further segmentation based on the composition of the lead sulphate could be appropriate. One lead smelter explained in this regard that a distinction can be made between:\n\n(a) lead sulphate from zinc smelters that have a goethite or jarosite residue pond (\u2018Type 1 lead sulphate\u2019). This lead sulphate has a relatively high concentration of lead and precious metals (such as gold and silver) and high moisture, because the iron content is captured in the precipitated goethite or jarosite molecules and separated in the residue pond.\n\n(b) lead sulphate from zinc smelters that do not have a goethite or jarosite residue pond (\u2018Type 2 lead sulphate\u2019). This lead sulphate has a higher concentration of iron, and therefore a lower concentration of lead and precious metals (such as gold and silver) and lower moisture.\n\n(c) lead sulphate can also result from the treatment of lead (\u2018Type 3 lead sulphate\u2019). In that case, it contains flue dusts and other residues. However, the composition of this type of lead sulphate is different from the by-product of zinc smelters as it typically has very low content of precious metals, if any.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, these three types of lead sulphate present different characteristics, especially in terms of moisture content, which plays an important role for lead smelters. As one lead smelter explained: \u2018All lead smelters pay attention to the moisture content, because the smelters need the capability and capacity to dry / process the lead concentrates or lead sulphates\u2019.\n\nThis is consistent with the information submitted by the Parties showing that [\u2026]. Again, the requirements of lead smelters in terms of heat balance limits demand substitutability between different types of lead sulphate with different moisture content.\n\nFrom a supply perspective, the circle of lead sulphate producers vary according to the type of lead sulphate (e.g. zinc smelters only produce Type 1 or 2 lead sulphate whereas other players can only produce Type 3 lead sulphate). As a result, supply-substitutability seems limited, at least between Type 1 and Type 2 lead sulphate on the one hand, and Type 3 lead sulphate, on the other hand.\n\nIn any event, for the purpose of this Decision, the distinction between different types of feedstock for lead production and between different types of lead sulphate can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts under any plausible product market definition. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Decision, the Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction under any product market definition that the Commission considers plausible, by distinguishing a separate market for lead sulphate with a further segmentation according to type of lead sulphate (as defined above)."

The Notifying Party considers that the market for lead sulphate is likely to be worldwide.\n\nThe results of the investigations suggest that the geographic market for lead sulphate is at least EEA-wide and potentially broader (e.g. worldwide or worldwide excluding China). The vast majority of respondents to the First Investigation indicated that prices for the supply of lead sulphate are similar across the EEA. In addition, the majority of participants confirmed that lead smelters can purchase lead sulphate from suppliers from all over the world.\n\nMoreover, several participants explained that Europe is a net exporter of lead sulphate. In particular, all participants to the First Investigation confirmed that imports into the EEA represent less than 20% of the volumes consumed in the EEA. Among them, the majority estimates that imports represent around 10% of the EEA market.\n\nThis is consistent with the data submitted by the Parties and other market participants, which confirm that lead is a low value and bulky product for which transport costs are significant. For instance, as one lead smelter explained: \u2018the market for lead sulphate [is] no broader than the EEA, as this product (at least in its regular quality) does not travel much, due to the high transportation costs and also because of its moisture content (there is a moisture limit for transportation by ship\u2019.\n\nIn any event, for the purpose of this Decision, it can be left open whether the market of lead sulphate is global or EEA-wide, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts under any market definition that the Commission considers plausible.

        "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission found that lead metal constitutes a distinct product market from lead concentrates and from other refined metals. The Commission also previously considered whether it would be appropriate to define separate product markets for each grade of lead metal (99.99%, 99.985% and 99.97% purity grade lead metal), in particular for applications that set higher requirements in terms of lead purity input.\n\nWhile ultimately leaving the question open, the Commission also considered a distinction between lead metal alloys and lead metal. Finally, the Commission rejected a distinction according to the feedstock used for the production of lead, i.e. lead made from concentrates (primary lead) and recycled lead (secondary lead).\n\nThe Parties do not contest that similar conclusions may also apply in this case. Therefore, the Parties presented information on the market for lead as a distinct product market from other metals, as well as for the different purity grades of lead metal.\n\nDuring the Second Investigation, the majority of respondents indicated that there are significant differences between grades, in particular as regards the applications they are used for. The majority of respondents explained that while not all customers purchase all types of lead metal, customers cannot change the grade of lead they use for the purpose of their activities. For some specific niche applications (e.g. optical glas, submarine cables) only 99.99% purity lead can be used. Lower grade (99.985% purity or less) accounts for the large majority of overall demand, roughly around 90%. This grade of lead is mostly used for the production of batteries.\n\nAs regards the difference between lead metal and lead metal alloys, the responses to the market investigations show that there are significant differences between lead metal and lead metal alloys, particularly in terms of chemical composition (e.g. calcium or antimony content) . Besides, the investigations did not elicit any result that would justify distinguishing primary and secondary lead metal.\n\nIn any event, given that the Transaction does not give rise to serious doubts under any plausible product market definition, the Commission considers that it can be left open whether the market for lead metal should be subsegmented according to purity grade. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Decision, the Commission will assess the effects of the Transaction under all plausible product market definitions, i.e. on separate markets for lead metal with a distinction by grade (i.e. 99.99%, 99.985%, 99.97% and lower)."

According to a majority of customers, CTS for indirect employee shareholding are typically sourced separately from different providers and based on different tenders than CTS for direct employee shareholding. Customers explained that this is because CTS for indirect employee shareholding require different management services and are provided by suppliers dealing with employee savings, such as Amundi and Natixis Interepargne, who are dedicated to this activity and do not provide CTS for direct employee shareholding or for investor shareholding. Indirect employee shareholders do not hold shares directly in the company as direct employee shareholders, but own units in an investment vehicle. The market investigation results were inconclusive regarding whether CTS providers are generally able to provide and whether they generally provide CTS for both direct and indirect employee shareholding and whether a company providing CTS for direct employee shareholding would be able to start providing for indirect employee shareholding. In any event, the JV will not be active in the provision of CTS for indirect employee shareholding. Therefore, in this case, a plausible market for CTS for indirect employee shareholding cannot be an affected market, and CTS for indirect employee shareholding will not be considered further in this decision."

Customers explained that \u201c[l]isted companies are more complex to handle in terms of regulations, number of shareholders \u201d, \u201c[r]egulations applicable to listed companies are much more stringent and more complex \u201d, \u201c[l]isted companies are subject to specific and complex regulatory environment (that does not apply in full to unlisted companies) which is necessary for a CTS provider to perfectly know and manage \u201d, and that \u201c[\u2026] listed companies have a larger number of shareholders, which generates needs in IT tools, human resources and expertise (for example regarding equity or tax matters) .\u201d In light of this, listed companies would not consider obtaining CTS for investor shareholding from a provider that does not have material experience with listed companies , because a proven track record with listed companies and solid knowledge of applicable regulation are considered important factors to source CTS for listed companies in France . Listed customers explained that \u201c[e]xperience of stock market regulations is a \"must have\" when considering a CTS provider,\u201d \u201c[we] select our providers on such sensitive topics based on their credentials and would trust only providers whose core activity is with listed companies ,\u201d \u201c[d]ealing with listed companies requires specialist skills and proven experience ,\u201d and \u201c[ we] [n]eed to have full confidence in the CTS provider .\u201d Furthermore, a few customers pointed to the riskiness of engaging a provider without significant experience with listed companies, explaining that \u201c[\u2026] obtaining CTS for investor shareholding from a CTS provider without material experience with listed companies is very risky, \u201d \u201c[a]s a listed company we do not take any risk relating to the management of our shareholders ,\u201d and \u201c[a]s a listed company, [we] can not take the risk of any issue related to the management of its share capital .\u201d As regards supply-side substitutability, the market investigation showed that providers of CTS for investor shareholding serving only unlisted companies would not be able to start serving listed companies within a short period of time and without significant investments in IT infrastructure and human capital.

As regards demand-side substitutability, a majority of customers responding to the Commission\u2019s market investigation view CTS for employee shareholding as an add-on to CTS for investor shareholding . The Commission\u2019s investigation revealed that, although CTS for investor shareholding and CTS for direct employee shareholding are similar with respect to, e.g. the organisation or general meetings and registrar services , CTS for direct employee shareholding require more direct engagement from the CTS personnel and more specific advisory services (e.g. tax). As one customer explained: \u201cAlthough [CTS for direct employee shareholding and CTS for investor shareholding] [are] considered as two different services, the provision of CTS services to general shareholders and employee shareholders are understood as equivalent in nature and workflow. [\u2026] The only difference between these two kinds of services is the significant assistance provided to employee shareholders, having more specific demands (e.g. asking more direct questions to [the customer\u2019s] in-house team) and often being subject to specific tax regimes that require blocking and/or specific tracking of the employee\u2019s shares .\u201d Another customer explained that \u201call CTS actors have dedicated teams for managing employee shareholders: global standard operations are processed by the standard teams and specific employee shareholders processes are handled by the dedicated teams working in liaison with the Issuer\u2019s HR Teams. \u201d Another customer indicates \u201c For direct holding of shares (of a dedicated group employing the employees), there is little to no difference between an on-employee and an employee shareholder in the management of account, [\u2026] Even if issuers are both clients of those CTS providers, those activities are managed via different tenders, offers and processes \u201d. Further, a majority of customers stated that they source CTS related to investor shareholding and CTS related to employee shareholding together from the same supplier , while some said they do not . However, customer feedback was inconclusive as to whether customers source these services based on the same or different tenders. It appears from the Commission\u2019s investigation that some of the Parties\u2019 customers for CTS related to investor shareholding do not source CTS for direct employee shareholding from the Parties or they do not source CTS for direct employee shareholding at all . As regards supply-side substitutability, a majority of competitors responding to the Commission\u2019s market investigation consider that the provision of CTS for investor shareholding and CTS for employee shareholding require different tools and/or skills . However, most respondents consider that CTS providers are generally able to provide both CTS for investor shareholding and CTS for direct employee shareholding . A slight majority of competitors consider it possible for a company providing only CTS for employee shareholding to be able to start providing CTS for investor shareholding (and vice versa) within a short period of time and without a significant investment , whereas nearly as large a number of competitors considered this would not be possible."

Specifically, as regards the in-house provision of CTS for listed companies, some companies currently in-source some of their CTS. However, listed customers that currently source CTS from an external provider consistently do not consider switching to performing CTS in-house as a realistic possibility. This is because in-house provision would require large and continuous investments in IT infrastructure and the hiring of a full team with relevant experience. Furthermore, an in-house CTS department would likely still need to rely on certain (e.g. IT) services provided by a third party. Therefore, for the purposes of the product market definition, in-house sourcing of CTS will not be considered as part of the relevant product market.

        "text": "In its decisional practice, the Commission has generally considered a separate market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas where large upstream producers and exporters tend to sell large volumes of gas to downstream wholesalers/importers. The Commission has also considered whether this market should encompass the upstream wholesale supply of liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d), but ultimately left this question open.\nThe Notifying Party submits that, as a result of the current geopolitical events, LNG has become a perfect substitute for natural gas via pipeline both in the EEA and Italy, and should therefore be considered as part of the overall market for upstream wholesale supplies of natural gas.\nIn defining whether two products belong to the same relevant product market, the Commission will typically assess whether there is demand and supply substitution for the products in question. The assessment of demand substitution entails a determination of the range of products, which are viewed as substitutes by the consumer. Supply substitution may be taken into account in situations where its effects are equivalent to those of demand substitution, namely when suppliers are able to switch production to the relevant products and market them in the short term without incurring significant additional costs.\nThe results of the market investigation confirm the Commission\u2019s practice to consider a separate market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas. The clear majority of operators in the upstream and downstream wholesale supply of natural gas confirmed that such a distinction is appropriate. As one respondent notes in this regard, \u201c[i]n Italy the supply and import of natural gas is a distinct activity [from] the resale of the commodity to final users. Consequently, the distinction between upstream wholesale and downstream wholesale is still valid\u201d.\nWith regard to whether the market should encompass both natural gas in gaseous form and LNG, the results of the market investigation were mixed.\nConsidering demand substitution, while the majority of customers on the upstream wholesale market source both natural gas and LNG, many view the two products as complementary rather than substitutable. This is mainly because of the differences in the supply structure, the import infrastructure involved and logistics between the procurement of gas in gaseous form and LNG. As one respondent submits, \u201cLNG can be sourced from a wider geographical area and the amount for each transaction is large (0.1 bcm). Natural gas [in gaseous form] can be sourced from specific geographical locations and can be purchased in smaller batches\u201d.\nWith regard to supply substitution, suppliers of natural gas in gaseous form and LNG are usually not the same parties. As explained by a respondent \u201c[t]he supply of natural gas depends [on] the transport infrastructures available [in] the country of origin. Consequently, it might be the case that some countries are equipped with both export pipelines and LNG facilities meanwhile others with just one of the two (ie. Azerbaijan) \u201d. In this same regard, another respondent notes \u201c[d]epending on the geographical source of the gas and the type of supplier, upstream suppliers usually specialize in the supply of either LNG or Natural Gas [in gaseous form] \u201d.\nIn any case, the question of whether the market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas should encompass both natural gas in gaseous form and LNG can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market, irrespective of the precise market delineation. The Commission\u2019s assessment does not change depending on whether LNG is considered part of the market, as the Parties\u2019 market shares do not differ materially between the two alternative market delineations . This is shown in the Commission\u2019s prospective analysis of the likely future developments on this market, with the replacement of Russian gas supplies by alternative sources, including LNG , in paragraphs (72) et seq . below.\nAs the In Salah JV is not active in the supply of LNG, and the supplies of Eni, Sonatrach and Equinor into Italy (where, as will be explained below, the Commission focuses its analysis) are primarily in gaseous form, the Commission will analyse the effects of the Transaction under the most conservative approach, focusing its assessment on production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas in gaseous form only."

        "text": "The Commission has previously found that the downstream wholesale supply of gas is a distinct product market . On this market importers/wholesalers, which procure natural gas from major producers, sell gas volumes to other resellers/distributors (wholesale supply), which in turn supply end-customers (retail supply), and may also sell directly to large end-customers.\nThe Commission has further considered, and has ultimately left the question open in its decisional practice, whether gas trading on hubs should be included in the market for the downstream wholesale supply of natural gas. A gas hub is an instrument, which facilitates exchanges of gas amongst market players in order to allow buyers and sellers to find sufficient volume for supply or demand exceeding the capacities in the short term. At gas hubs, gas producers, downstream gas wholesalers and retailers as well as certain industrial customers can both physically as well as financially trade gas. The hub can be either physical in nature or a virtual trading point.\nThe Notifying Party submits that the downstream gas wholesale model in Italy offers traders two ways to buy and sell gas, namely either through over-the-counter, bilateral contracts with delivery at the Punto di Scambio Virtuale (PSV) or through transactions on the regulated exchange managed by the Gestore dei Mercati Energetici (GME). In bilateral, over the counter sales, trading partners are generally in direct contact with each other or make use of a broker, and agreements on trading volumes and pricing are reached individually and bilaterally among the parties. Sales on regulated exchanges are, by contrast, cleared and settled by a central counterparty, usually an exchange platform, and subject to standard contracts for standard volumes. According to the Notifying Party, the market for the downstream wholesale supply of gas in Italy should encompass both contracts with delivery point at the PSV, and transactions on the regulated exchange managed by GME.\nThe results of the market investigation confirm that the Commission\u2019s decision practice is still relevant. A clear majority of respondents submit that the Commission\u2019s practice of considering a separate market for the downstream wholesale supply of gas is appropriate . As one respondent explains, \u201c[t]he downstream wholesale market indeed covers the activities of reselling the gas at either the downstream wholesale level or the retail level \u201d.\nThe Commission further investigated whether it would be relevant to draw a distinction between whether the gas traded in the downstream wholesale market originated from LNG or natural gas in gaseous form . The market investigation clarified that such a distinction is not relevant for the downstream wholesale supply of natural gas. One respondent explains in this regard \u201conce the gas is on the Italian network, there is no difference between gas originating from gas in gaseous form or LNG \u201d, while another respondent explains that there are no differences in pricing, as \u201c[o]nce the gas entered into the Italian transmission grid, the reference price is the PSV\u201d.\nLastly, the majority of all respondents submit that in Italy, the market for the downstream wholesale supply of gas consists of both bilateral transactions over the counter with delivery point at the PSV, and trading on the regulated exchange platform managed by GME . The majority of both suppliers and purchasers in the Italian downstream wholesale supply market submit that they engage in both types of transactions. In any case, the question whether bilateral transactions over the counter with delivery point at the PSV, and trading on the regulated exchange platform managed by GME belong to the same market can be left open, as Eni\u2019s market shares would be close to identical under any alternative market delineation.\nThe Commission will therefore conduct the assessment of the Transaction considering a market for the downstream wholesale supply of natural gas, without distinguishing further between (i) natural gas in gaseous form and natural gas that originated from LNG, and (ii) between bilateral, over the counter gas supply contracts with delivery point at the PSV and transactions on the regulated exchange managed by GME."

In the most recent case relating to the Transmediterranean pipeline connecting the Italian transmission grid with the production fields in Algeria, the market investigation was inconclusive and the Commission left open whether international pipelines and regasification terminals belong to the same relevant product market. The Commission further considered whether the Transmediterranean pipeline is a natural monopoly, since it is the only pipeline connecting the Italian transmission grid to the Algerian production fields. However, the Commission eventually left this question open and conducted its analysis considering, on a precautionary basis, that the Transmediterranean pipeline belongs to the overall market for gas import infrastructure, while also considering the narrower potential market for international gas pipelines.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest the Commission\u2019s previous findings.\nThe results of the market investigation do not provide reasons for the Commission to depart from the findings in its recent decisions. For the purposes of this decision and in line with its findings in its most recent case relating to the Transmediterranean pipeline, the Commission will conduct its assessment under the narrowest potential market definition, considering the Transmediterranean pipeline as a natural monopoly for the import of Algerian gas into Italy."

        "text": "The Commission has previously found the market for upstream wholesale supplies of natural gas to potentially comprise the EEA, as well as at least imports from Algeria and Russia . In some decisions concerning specific regional areas, the Commission has found that the market could be narrower in scope, i.e. either regional (i.e. encompassing several Member States) or national in scope, where there was limited interconnection infrastructure or a lack of available cross-border capacity.\nThe Notifying Party submits that the geographic scope of the market should encompass the EEA, including exports from third countries into the EEA.\nThe results of the market investigation indicate that, from a supply side, the geographic scope of the market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of natural gas is narrower than the EEA. In order to supply their gas, undertakings on this market depend on the available gas transport infrastructure, connecting their production fields with the downstream markets. As a respondent explains, upstream gas wholesalers will supply their gas to the regions where there is the necessary infrastructure in place, to accommodate for the gas shipments: \u201c[d]ue to the nature of pipelines which tend to be point-to-point, suppliers which rely on pipelines to provide gas in gaseous form supply to points where pipeline networks can deliver (\u2026)\u201d. Gas production fields, however, are typically not connected through transport pipelines with each part of the EEA. Furthermore, the Commission received indications that limited interconnection infrastructure or lack of available cross-border capacity still exist within at least parts of the EEA, limiting flows of gas within the EEA .\nSince, as will be explained further below, the activities of both the In Salah JV and Eni on the market for the development, production and upstream wholesale supply of gas concern Italy, the Commission focused its market investigation on Italy .\nWith regard to the demand side, the majority of respondents in Italy who procure gas from the upstream wholesale market submit that they do so on an EEA-or-wider basis. Regarding the countries outside the EEA, where the majority of respondents in Italy submits to source gas from, the most frequently mentioned are Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Russia and for LNG, Qatar.\nAs is evidenced by the origin of the composition of gas imported and consumed in Italy, supplies of gas in gaseous form to Italy primarily originate outside the EEA, and in particular in Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Russia, as well as within the EEA, primarily Norway . It follows that transport infrastructure is in place that enables upstream production and wholesale suppliers to sell gas from Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Russia and Norway to the Italian gas network.\nIn light of the above, the Commission will conduct its analysis on the basis of a market that comprises upstream wholesale supplies of natural gas in gaseous form into Italy, including exports to Italy from Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya and Russia."

In some instances, the Commission has considered whether several gas hubs (located in different Member States) could be considered as part of the same geographic market, for reasons of price convergence, leaving however the question open.\nThe Notifying Party submits that, because European gas hubs are increasingly interconnected, with a growing number of physical connections and bi-directional supply flows, there is increased liquidity and price convergence across the EEA and that, therefore, the geographic market is wider than national.\nResponses to the market investigation were not conclusory regarding a wider than national geographic market. Some actors on this market submit that they could acquire gas directly from downstream wholesale markets of adjacent countries (e.g. Austria, Switzerland) for their requirements in Italy. However, the majority of all respondents who provided a definite answer submit that less than 15% of the gas that is traded on the Italian downstream wholesale market (i.e. through PSV and GME) is further exported, in order to cover demand outside Italy, which suggests that gas flows across a region wider than national remain limited. Conversely, inasmuch, the results of the market investigation suggest that the market for downstream wholesale supply of gas with regard to Italy is at least national in scope.\nIn any case, the exact geographic scope of the market can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition. For the purposes of this decision, the Commission will conduct the assessment on the narrowest potential geographic scope, considering the market for downstream wholesale supply of natural gas in Italy to be national in scope."

One customer  explains that \u201c PA66 EP is formulated accordingly the different application needs, PA66 BP is used to produce PA66 EP \u201d. Furthermore, on the supply side, a majority of competitors outlined that they would not be able to switch their production of PA6.6 BP to that of PA6.6 EP, and vice versa. Indeed, these are vastly different production processes : the production of PA6.6 BP is more capital intensive than that of PA6.6 EP, and the production of PA6.6 EP is technically less complicated. According  to the  Parties, setting up a new compounding line would typically cost $3.5 to $6.5 million and take 10 to 18 months.

Furthermore, polymerisation is a chemical rea ction, whereas compounding is a mixing process. Therefore, considerations such as health and safety procedures, process control, supply chain management, are more stringent for polymerisation than for compounding, as it is a higher hazard process."

T he Targets breed and license only table grape vine varieties. The Commission considers that table grape vines and wine grape vines belong to two separate product markets. From  the demand side  persp ective , as highlighted by the Parties, the product characteristics are materially different  between table and wine grape vines  in respect to: (i) growing climate conditions (wine grape vines are more resistant to different climate conditions whereas table grape vines are suited for warm and dry climates  only); (ii) sweetness  (wine grape  vines need to produce grapes containing more sugar which is used for the creation of alcohol whereas table grapes with high level of sugar may deteriorate faster) ; (iii) pre sence of seeds, thick skin and size (wine grape vines should produce grapes with seeds, thick skin and small size; all characteristics valued in the production of wine whereas customers of table grapes value the  opposite characteristics, i.e. seedless, thi n skin and big size ); (iv) yield and revenue (wine grape vines normally produce around half the volume of grapes which are sold at a lower price  in comparison to table grapes vines). From a supply side perspective  as well,  all differences discussed above imply a limited supply -side substitutability. Breeders cannot promptly and effectively use wine grape vine varieties to produce grape vine varieties with the specific characteristics demanded by downstream customers . This is confirmed by more than one breeder that  have either tried and abandoned the use of wine grape vine varieties in their table grape program, or have been trying for more than 8 years to develop a variety that combines one characteristic of wine grape vines (i.e. its antioxidant properties) with the desired characteristics for table grapes. The market investigation supported this finding as breeders confirmed that traits characteristic of table grape vines and opposite to those of wine grape vines (e.g. production of grapes that are crunchy, seedless, with thin skin, and log shelf live) are the traits of their most successful grape varieties with table grape growers  as well as the targeted traits in their breeding activities targeting these customers . The fact that competitive dynamics are specific to each of these products is also reflected by internal documents. The Parties in the ordinary course of business monitor how traits specific to table grape vines and not relevant for wine grape vines are ref lected in recent product launches by their competitors ."

        "text": "Although both Targets currently license almost exclusively seedless table grape vine varieties, the Commission assessed  whether the product market includes both seeded and seed less table grape vines. On the demand side, growers\u2019 decision on whether to plant seeded or seedless table grape vines is primarily driven by the preferences of the final consum ers downstream who value the different organoleptic characteristics of seedless grapes. The consumers\u2019 preference for seedless grapes has increased over time and is expected to increase further resulting in a clear market trend towards the progressive repl acement of seeded varieties with seedless varieties and pointing towards the limited substitutability between seedless and seeded table grape vine varieties. The market investigation supports this finding as the majority of growers consider the consumers\u2019 preference for seedless grapes as the main differentiating factor between seedless and seeded table grape vine varieties. In addition, the Parties\u2019 estimates of new hectares planted in the EEA show the already small [5 -10]% share of seeded varieties in 2 020 drop to [0 -5]% in 2022. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of market players interviewed expect the consumers\u2019 demand for seedless grapes to grow further. However, should the shift in consumers\u2019 preference for seedless grapes stop in the future  or point towards seeded grapes, there are no other intrinsic differences between seedless and seeded vine grape varieties that would limit demand -side substitutability. The vast majority of respondents to the  market investigation noted that growers can easily switch between new plantings of seedless and of seeded table grape vines. In addition, according to the majority of the growers, in general, seedless and seeded vines can be very similar in terms of yield, costs, stability, durability and difficulty to grow . On the supply side, substitutability is limited because breeders willing to start providing seedless varieties would need to undergo a lengthy process . Creating a seedless variety  can take several years due to the required successive cross- breeding and the time needed for vines to grow and develop, while it is not technically possible to speed up breeding cycles. However , it is worth noting that due to the consumers\u2019 preference  for seedless grapes (making seedless varieties an economically attractive growth opportunity) both public institutions and private breeders (from international breeders like the Targets, to local cooperatives of growers) either are already breeding and li censing seedless varieties or are ready to enter the market in the near future with new seedless varieties. Competitors noted that it takes between eight and 15 years to create a new variety. However, they also clarified that their current most successfu l varieties are seedless and that they have on average five other varieties under development that they expect to commercialize within the next five to ten years. In this industry such timeframe can still be considered reasonable given that grape vines are expected to begin yielding fruit in two to three years after they are planted and then be productive for an additional 22 to 23 years. Although the market investigation indicated that seedless table grape vine varieties are differentiated from seede d table grape vine varieties, f or the purpose of this Decision, it can be left open whether the product market includes both seeded and seedless table grape vine varieties since the Transaction would not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with th e internal market even under the narrowest plausible market definition, i.e. breeding and licensing of seedless table grape vine varieties."

On the demand side, growers\u2019 decision on whether to plant protected or public table grape vines is driven by both product differences valued by grow ers as well as the preferences of the final consumers downstream. This is because, in order to obtain a return on their investment through plant variety protection, private breeders and public institutions invest in R&D aiming to enhance certain grape vine varieties for characteristics that are preferred by growers (e.g. yield, durability, stability) and organoleptic characteristics of grapes preferred by final consumers (e.g. flavour, crunchiness, uniformit y, size). Although these differences seem to indicate a limited demand- side substitutability between protected and public grape vine varieties, this is mitigated by public varieties\u2019 lower prices and wider accessibility as well as by the growers\u2019 ability t o switch. The market investigation supported this finding as the majority of growers consider that public grape vine varieties have, in general, lower yield, lower stability and durability. The majority of respondents also acknowledge that final custome rs prefer protected varieties. However, respondents to the market investigation noted that growers can easily switch between new plantings of protected and of public table grape vines . In addition, according to the majority of the growers, in general, protected varieties have higher yield and durability whereas public varieties cost less and are more easily accessible. On the supply side, substitutability is limited because a currently public variety cannot be protected and because breeders willing to provide protected varieties would need to undergo a lengthy process. Given that breeders can apply for protection only for new varieties, creating a new variety that can be protected takes  several years due to the required successive cross- breeding and the time needed for vines to grow and develop, while it is not technically possible to speed up breeding cycles. However , it is worth noting that, due to the consumers\u2019 preference for grapes from protected varieties as well as the current market trend pushing growers to value and pay for protected varieties, public institutions that used to create new varieties and make them public are starting to protect their new varieties or are partnering with private entities (cooperatives of growers or companies) , blurring the line between public and private breeders . This is acknowledged by the Parties, for several public institutions  who have recently been active with licensing of protected varieties, and confirmed by the market investigation.  Competitors noted that it takes between eight and 15 years to create a new variety. Historically public institutions that could have developed public varieties noted that they have on average five other varieties under development for which they expect to apply for EU-wide protect ion with the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO ) within the next five to ten years. In this industry such timeframe can  still be considered reasonable given that grape vines are expected to begin yielding fruit in two to thr ee years after they are planted and then be productive for an additional 22 to 23 years.

The Commission ultimately left open the exact market definition.\n\nThe Notifying Parties submit that international pipelines constitute a separate product market from regasification terminals.\n\nThe results of the market investigation conducted in the present case were inconclusive on whether regasification terminals and pipelines are substitutable.\n\nWith regard to demand -side substitutability, the responses of customers were split, with a slight majority of those who provided a definite answer not considering the two types of gas import infrastructure as substitutable. A majority of  customers who provided a definite answer submitted that the differences in the regulatory and operational aspects between  regasification terminals  and international pipelines affect their substitutability from the demand side . Respondents pointed specifically to the fact that, although both types of infrastructures ultimately deliver the same gas molecule to the market, they have different transport structures and logistics, whose associated risks differ accordingly. Thus, the decision to import gas in gaseous form  via international pipelines or as LNG  that requires regasification is part of the initial economic assessment of gas importers, and is a choice made for the long term. Gas importers cannot switch between pipelines and regasification terminals in a cost- and time -efficient manner due to the fact that the choice of the gas import infrastructure is defined by the upstream gas or LNG supply contract. Further, the market investigation indicated that, while all customers import gas in gaseous form through international pipelines, less than half also import gas in liquefied form through regasification terminals.\n\nMoreover, the results of the market investigation indicate that there is no substitution on the supply side between the provision of regasification services through LNG terminals and the provision of gas transport services through international pipelines in Italy. In fact, apart from SNAM, no other operator of a gas import infrastructure offers both regasification services through LNG terminals and gas transport services through international pipelines.\n\nThe Commission considers that, for the purposes of this decision, it may be left open whether international pipelines and regasification terminals belong to the same relevant product market or belong to separate product markets, as the Transaction does not lead to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market, regardless of the market definition adopted. The Commission will assess the Transaction both in the context of an overall market for gas import infrastructure, comprising gas pipelines and LNG terminals, as well as in the narrowest potential market for gas pipelines."

        "text": "The results of the market investigation with regard to the substitutability between different pipelines, connecting the Italian transmission grid with different sources of gas, are open to interpretation.\n\nOn the one hand, a clear majority of both customers and competitors submitted that different pipelines are generally not interchangeable. Some of the customers replied that there could be some interchangeability between different pipelines connecting the Italian transmission grid with different spot markets in Europe, but the same would not apply when considering pipelines connected to gas production sites, such as the Transmediterranean Pipeline.\n\nRespondents noted that the lack of interchangeability from the demand side is mainly linked to the fact that different pipelines are connected to different sources of gas (i.e. specific gas production fields) . Supply contracts with production fields are in turn usually long -term. As a result, the ability of gas importers to switch import infrastructure is linked to the existence and the duration of their upstream gas supply contracts. These upstream gas supply contracts are also gas - or LNG -specific, which also defines the use of either pipelines or LNG terminals for the import into Italy .\n\nFrom the perspective of the supply -side, substitutability between pipelines is limited by the fact that usually there will be only one pipeline connecting a gas production field with the Italian transmission network. In fact, the Transmediterranean Pipeline is the only infrastructure allowing for the import of natural gas (in gaseous form) originating from the Algerian gas production fields, into Italy.\n\nOn the other hand , the majority of both customers and competitors also replied that in their view the Transmediterranean Pipeline is in fact competing with other gas import infrastructures for customers , which seems to be in contradiction with their view that different pipelines are in general not interchangeable.\n\nTaking the overall feedback into account, the Commission interprets the responses of the participants to the market investigation as follows:\nIt is clear from the overall responses that, once a gas shipper has entered into a gas -supply contract with a specific source of gas (which will be gas - or LNG -specific), the available infrastructures for importing this gas into Italy are defined. Where there is only a single pipeline connecting Italy to the specific source of gas, there can be no competition among the various pipelines from that point on.\n\nOne customer explained in this regard that, when deciding to conclude a new gas-supply contract with a source of gas, they consider all relevant factors, such as gas price, logistic costs to bring gas to Italy, the flexibility of the supply contract, reliability of the gas source etc. At this moment, the relevant sources of gas and, as an extension, the relevant infrastructures are in competition with other sources and their infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the feedback from the market investigation suggests that the choice of the import infrastructure plays only a minor role in the choice of the gas -supply contract in the upstream market. When asked to rank their criteria in deciding where to source gas from, customers ranked the price of the natural gas as the most important factor, followed by the features of the gas supply agreement, reliability of supplier and lastly the transportation tariffs and the need for portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Commission therefore understands that competition primarily takes place in the upstream market for the gas supply, and that the gas import infrastructure only plays a secondary role in the decision to source gas from one source or the other .\n\nIn any case, and given the ambiguity of the feedback from the market investigation, the Commission considers that the question whether the Transmediterranean Pipeline is to be regarded as a natural monopoly can be left open , as the Transaction does not raise concerns regardless of the precise market delineation . For the purposes of this decision the Commission will conduct the assessment under the most conservative basis , considering that the Transmediterranean Pipeline does not constitute a monopoly and will consider a market covering other import infrastructures as well, whether both regasification terminals and international pipelines, or international pipelines alone."

        "text": "The results of the market investigation indicated that with respect to catenaries and overhead contact lines, installation and maintenance are within the same product market. A significant majority of both customers and competitors stated that installers of catenaries and overhead contact lines are also able to provide maintenance services, and vice versa. Installation and maintenance services are also typically sourced by the same customers, although some railway infrastructure operators carry out the maintenance of their infrastructure in -house.\nFurthermore , the results of the market investigation indicated that a separation by type of system, between catenarie s and overhead contact lines, on the one hand, and third rail systems , on the other hand, is warranted. A majority of both customers and competitors submit ted that installation of third rail systems is not offered by installers of catenaries and overhead c ontact lines . This is because know-how and required equipment differs, and third -lines are carried out by track installers , rather than catenary installers . As one competitor noted, \u201c[t]here is a big difference in equipment and know -how between laying trac ks (track) and placing overhead contact lines installations (catenary). The concerned workforce requires very divers skills.\u201d Furthermore, as third -rail systems are typically used in underground railways, while catenaries and overhead contact lines are p rimarily used in above -ground railways , both systems serve a different purpose and are not sourced together .\nThe results of the market investigation were , however , inconclusive on whether the market for the installation and maintenance of catenaries and overhead contact lines should be further segmented by type of customer, i.e. between long -distance and metropolitan rail. A majority of customers responded that inst allers of catenaries and overhead contact lines for long -distance rail can also provide their services for metropolitan rail, and vice versa. However, many respondents explain ed that while the technical principles applicable to both segments are the same, the long -distance rail segment is more demanding in terms of certifications and the necessary installation equipment, and there might also be different training requirements for the personnel. Furthermore, as long -distance rail is typically operated by t he national railway infrastructure operator, while metropolitan rail is typically operated by the urban railway infrastructure operator s, customers are not the same for installation and maintenance services in long -distance rail and metropolitan rail.\nThe Commission has further assessed whether within the potential segment for long-distance rail a further distinction between con ventional rail and high -speed rail would be warranted. The results of the market investigation showed that such a distinction is n ot necessary. The majority of both customers and competitors noted that service providers are able to provide installation and maintenance for both conve ntional long -distance rail and high -speed rail. Although some respondents point ed to some differ ences in the installation, most of them also noted that it is the same service providers who are active in the installation and maintenance of catenaries and overhead contact lines for both conventional and high -speed rail and that they serve the same customers . One competitor explained that such differences in the installation exist between all kinds of different types of catenaries (such as catenaries for use under bridges etc.) The Commission therefore does not consider that such differences justify the defin ition of a separate product market.\nIn light of the above , the Commission will assess the Transaction on the basis of a market comprising the provision of both installation and maintenance services for catenaries and overhead contact lines, excluding thir d rail systems , with a particular focus on long -distance rail . Further distinction s within long -distance rail , such as between conventional and high -speed rail do not change the Commission\u2019s assessment . As the Parties are not active in the instal lation and maintenance of third rail systems, this market will not be further assessed."

        "topic": "High-speed Rolling Stock",
        "text": "The Parties consider that there is a single overall product market for high-speed trains operating at speeds of 250 km/h and above and that trains capable of speeds at or above 300 km/h (\u2018very\u2019 high-speed rolling stock) do not constitute a separate market.\nFirst, the Notifying Party states that the same regulations apply to all trains capable of speeds at or above 250 km/h. In that regard, it indicates that EU legislation and policy documents only provide definition and specific technical requirements for trains capable of speeds at or above 250 km/h, without specific references to trains capable of speeds at or above 300 km/h.\nAccording to the Notifying Party, once requirements for speeds of 250 km/h are met, most technical requirements do not differ between high-speed and very high-speed trains. Any additional technical requirements (and any related costs) for reaching speeds above 300 km/h are incremental and are obtained through an extension of the same technology.\nSecond, the Notifying Party states that high-speed rolling stock suppliers can develop new platforms or adapt existing platforms to allow for higher speeds. High-speed rolling stock suppliers can thus rely on their technical know-how and capacity to develop trains operating at higher speeds.\nIn that regard, the Notifying Party submits that the speed increase does not require significant technical modifications. Operating speed only impacts a few components and sub-components, requiring replacement or adaptation in line with the new speed, and which represent a negligible part of the total platform costs. In addition, the overall trainset architecture and the interior do not need to be changed, saving rolling stock suppliers significant cost and time. Furthermore, the Notifying Party considers that R&D investment to convert a high-speed platform into a very high-speed one is limited and a supplier having developed a 250 km/h solution may participate in a very high-speed tender with very little upfront investment.\nThird, the Notifying Party considers that tender specifications and infrastructure costs do not provide a basis for distinguishing between high-speed and very high-speed trains.\nIn particular, the Notifying Party claims that trains with maximum speeds below 300 km/h can compete in tenders for trains capable of speeds of 300 km/h or above. Conversely, trains capable of running at speeds above 300 km/h may compete in tenders for trains operating between 250 -300 km/h. In that regard, the Notifying Party indicates that multiple suppliers use the same platform in both high-speed and very high-speed tenders.\nThe Notifying Party further states that customers for high-speed trains do not use 300 km/h as a relevant threshold. In that regard, it indicates that maximum speed is often not the main factor of choice for high-speed operators and that customers sometimes express their requirement in journey time rather than in terms of maximum speed. In addition, certain customers are interested in flexible rolling stock solutions with platforms capable of high-speed and very high-speed.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the Notifying Party considers that the Commission\u2019s findings in its decision in case M.8677 - Siemens/Alstom (hereinafter \u2018Siemens/Alstom \u2019) regarding the specific characteristics of tracks allowing for very high-speed travel and having higher construction costs are insufficient to warrant a distinction between high-speed and very high-speed trains. In that regard, it states that there is no general difference in construction costs between high-speed and very high-speed dedicated tracks, because each line has specific geographic and other considerations that may have an important impact on construction costs. Moreover, it states that there is a certain level of substitutability between tracks dedicated to high and very high-speeds, since several trains that are not capable of speeds of 300 km/h or above are operating on very high-speed tracks across the EEA.\nBased on the above, according to the Notifying Party, the question of a speed threshold within the high-speed market is not a decisive issue from both supplier and customer perspectives.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party considers that the question of a potential segmentation of the market between high-speed and very high-speed trains can be left open as the competitive conditions do not change materially regardless of the market definition."

In addition, it states that while many suppliers may only offer one type of traction and/or architecture, this does not prevent them from competing in tenders against suppliers whose offerings are based on different traction systems or architecture.\nWith respect to number of floors, the Notifying Party indicates that most tenders do not include any specifications related to single - or double -deck high -speed trains . Therefore , the Notifying Party considers that single -deck and double -deck platforms are typically perceived as substitutable from a customer standpoint and compete closely in most tenders.

        "text": "The Commission considers that the findings in relation to a possible segmentation of the high-speed rolling stock market distinguishing very high -speed trains as explained in Siemens/Alstom remain applicable for the purpose of the present decision.\nThe results of the market investigation conducted in the present case thus confirmed that high-speed trains (capable of a speed equal to or higher than 250 km/h) are not substitutable with very high -speed trains (capable of a speed equal to or higher than 300 km/h). The majority of respondents consider that very high-speed rolling stock belong to a separate market, mainly because of (i) their operational speed capacity and performance, which allow for travel at 300 km/h and above, (ii) dedicated lines used to operate them , and (iii) specific technical requirements, price and investment needed to develop such rolling stock.\nFrom the demand -side, major high -speed and very high-speed lines operators such as Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (\u2018FSI\u2019, Italy) and SNCF (France) confirmed that very high-speed rolling stock constitute a separate relevant market. SNCF explained in that regard that the condition of exploitation of high -speed and very high -speed rolling stock differ, and that trains running at speed below 300 km/h cannot be operated on very high -speed dedicated track without disturbing the service. SNCF further explained that the European Technical Standards of Interoperability ( \u2018TSI\u2019) specifications for very high -speed rolling stock do differ and are more demanding than high -speed rolling stock (requiring, for example , that mechanical parts be of greater strength for a very high -speed train than for a high -speed trains ).\nOn the other hand, some customers, including Deutsche Bahn (Germany), Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori ( \u2018NTV \u2019, Italy) and High Speed Two ( \u2018HS2\u2019, United Kingdom), consider that a distinction between high -speed and very high -speed rolling stock may not be warranted. They indicated that they operate both kinds of fleets and consider that technical requirements for running high -speed and very high -speed do not significantly differ .\nHowever, these customers also recognised that they have a specific demand for very high-speed rolling stock and that they would not procure a high -speed train to be operated on very high -speed tracks. This is because the procurement of a very high-speed train aims at maximising the performance allowed by the railway infrastructure, which would not be possible with a high -speed train. For instance, HS2 indicated that investments in very high -speed dedicated tracks aim to \u2018HS2 Ltd is procuring very high -speed rolling stock capable of 360km/h operation on infrastructure designed for 360km/h operation. This is to maximise the capacity benefits of the [very] high-speed infrastructure and achieve HS2 Ltd\u2019s Sponsor Requirements (set by the UK Department for Transport). \u2019 This is consistent with the Commission\u2019s findings in Siemens/Alstom , where investments in very high -speed dedicated tracks were found to rely on major policy decisions and to involve substantial public spending in order to specifically achieve speeds that only very high-speed trains can achieve.\nFrom the supply -side, a large majority of rolling stock suppliers agree that multiple factors justify distinguishing high-speed and very high -speed rolling stock markets .\nFirst, high-speed and very high -speed trains differ in performance. As stated in Siemens/Alstom , very high -speed trains are designed to travel long distances at speeds over 300 km/h (other high-speed trains are designed to travel at speeds between 250 km/h and cannot reach 300 km/h) . In order to achieve speeds above 300 km/h, suppliers explained that very high -speed trains need specific technological development , such as sophisticated aerodynamics, and strict safety requirement, such crash tests. In addition, respondents explained that the design and manufacture of a very high -speed train require a specific combination of special pre -calculations and laboratory tests prior to performing track tests.\nSecond , respondents to the market investigation indicated that customers generally specify the speed required ( i.e., at least 300 km/h in a very high-speed tender). In certain cases, customers request bidders to have a certified very high -speed platform in order to be capable to participate in the tender.\nThird , as a results of the above, the technical and commercial development of a very high-speed platform with certified technology require more than 10 years and very significant investments , significantly higher than those needed to develop a high -speed platform.\nIt follows from the above that very high -speed rolling stock appear to constitute a distinct relevant market. However, it is not necessary to conclude on the precise delineation of the relevant product market for the assessment of the effects of the Transaction for the purpose of the present decision . For the reasons set out at paragraphs (281) , the Commission will focus its competitive assessment on the market for very high -speed (including all trains capable of a speed equal to or higher than 300 km/h)."

As a result, mainline trains can accommodate passengers in all cars and do not have dedicated vehicles with no passenger access (such as locomotives) at the front and end of the train that provide the pull.

        "text": "The Notifying Party indicates that , as established by the Commission in Siemens/Alstom, mainline trains differ from high -speed trains on the basis of regulatory and technical differences related to maximum speed. It explains that trains travelling at or above 250 km/h must respect additional technical specifications under the TSI. Nevertheless, in the Notifying Party\u2019s view, it cannot be excluded that future intercity tenders will not be constrained by competition from 250 km/h high -speed trains . The Notifying Party argues that although high -speed and intercity trains are not part of the same market, high -speed trains can be offered for intercity tenders as long as they meet the customer\u2019s tender requirements (including those related to price) and that high -speed trains can be authorised , and therefore operated, at speeds below 250 km/h.\nThe Notifying Party submits that mainline trains differ from metros due to the network on which they operate. While metros operate on closed urban mass transit networks, mainline trains operate on mainline networks covering transport between city centers and suburban areas, different cities, regions, and countries. Moreover, mainline trains are characterized by higher speeds, less frequent stops, lower passenger capacity, and higher comfort level compared to metros.\nThe Notifying Party considers that there is no clear segmentation between regional and intercity trains based on supply -side characteristics but that there may be certain differences from a demand -side perspective.\nThe Notifying Party puts forward a number of arguments against distinguishing regional from intercity trains, including the absence of any commonly accepted industry definition and the substitutability of product lines between regional and intercity trains from a supply -side perspective. In particular, the Notifying Party asserts that all major players are already active in both markets. The remaining regional -only suppliers can easily expand into the intercity market in view of the limited technical and regulatory differences between regional and intercity trains.\nFurthermore, the Notifying Party argues that suppliers can upgrade regional trains for operation at intercity speeds with limited costs. The Notifying Party explains that intercity speeds are often already incorporated into the pre -design of regional trains.\nIn relation to the distinction between EMUs and DMUs, the Notifying Party recognises that they may constitute separate product markets. The Notifying Party also explains that new technologies are emerging, including bimode trains which operate on routes consisting of both electrified and non -electrified lines within a single journey without stops or changes by switching between electrical traction and diesel engine power. Other technologies are hydrogen fuel -cell trains that provide an emission -free alternative to DMUs on non -electrified lines, and BEMUs on the other hand, provide emission -free alternatives to bimode trains which operate on both electrified and non -electrified lines to avoid interchanges on a route.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party explains that the Parties\u2019 activities only overlap in EMUs as Bombardier has not supplied any DMU trains in the past 10 years and does not have a DMU train in its portfolio.\nIn the Notifying Party\u2019s view, single -decker and double -decker trains are not likely to constitute separate markets.\nFrom the demand -side perspective, customers\u2019 requests for tenders typically do not contain specific architecture requirements as customers tender projects based on capacity requirements and are willing to consider both single - and double -decker architectures. The Notifying Party explains that suppliers decide on the architecture of their offer taking into account customers\u2019 capacity and length requirements and infrastructural constraints (e.g., platform length), and their existing portfolio. According to the Notifying Party, on a limited number of occasions, suppliers offered different architectures in the same project.\nFrom the supply -side perspective, the Notifying Party submits that all major suppliers have single- and double -decker platforms in their portfolio. Furthermore, the Notifying Party considers that the recent trend for mixed train configuration platforms (i.e., platforms that combine both single - and double -decker cars) further blurs the distinction between single - and double -decker trains.\nThe Notifying Party submits that the competitive assessment should be carried out by combining speed (intercity/regional) and propulsion (EMU/DMU) in order to reflect commercial reality in tenders. In the Notifying Party\u2019s view, customers always specify both the maximum operating speed and power supply requirements in their tender specifications.\nThe Notifying Party indicates, nonetheless, that the market definition can be left open as the Transaction does not give rise to any competition concerns regardless of the precise delineation of the relevant market."

Therefore, for the purpose of the present decision, only trains capable of a maximum speed below 250 km/h will fall in the mainline rolling stock category.\nSecond , with regard to the distinction between self -propelled and locomotive -hauled trains, a large majority of respondents confirms that distinction. This is due to the fact that locomotive -hauled trains consist of essentially two products, wagons and a locomotive, whereas self -propelled trains consist of a single trainset involving inherently different and more sophisticated technology. Accordingly, from the demand -side, self -propelled and locomotive -hauled trains are used for different services and involve different exploitation and maintenance facilities and management."

        "text": "As regards the possible segmentation of the market for mainline rolling stock into regional and intercity trains, a majority of respondents to the market investigation (both customers and competitors ) considered that regional and intercity trains are not substitutable. Respondents note that intercity and regional trains have distinct features and answering to different customer needs in terms of speed, number of stops, distance operated, passenger capacity, passenger comfort and accessibility .\nWhen procuring mainline trains, customers typically distinguish in tender specifications between regional and intercity trains in view of requested speed and other characteristics . Despite a certain degree of overlap between products in each market in terms of maximum speeds (certain regional trains being capable /operating above 160 km/h), customers consider that the distinction remains valid due to their different features (interior layout and amenities) and technical characteristics, predominantly speed but also capacity, length, number of doors, and other features. Arriva Tog AS explains that \u2018although there is some cross -over, in general the characteristics of an intercity train (high speed, few passenger doors, large seat spacing, kitchen provision etc.) are different to those of a regional train (lower speed , more doors to facilitate rapid boarding, closer seat spacing) \u2019. This view is also supported by competitors.\nWith regard to speed, even in the absence of an industry definition or a technical segmentation at the 160 km/h speed mark, the results of the market investigation largely confirm that a distinction between trains capable of operating at speeds above and below 160 km/h is valid.\nNevertheless, customers also confirm that trains initially designed for regional/commuter traffic but with intercity configurations built into their pre -design may be competitive in intercity tenders if the other requirements listed at paragraph are met."

Below these temperatures, bitumen solidifies and becomes unusable. Likewise, storage of bitumen is limited to dedicated heated tanks. As such, bitumen is a logistics -intensive product.\nIn past decisions, the Commission has considered that bitumen should be distinguished from other refined oil products based on its characteristics and its specific end -use.

The position is different only with regard to the supply of gas to electricity producers, the volume of L gas consumed by power stations being very limited.\nL gas and H gas require the use of separate delivery infrastructures, both for transmission and for storage, that are not interchangeable.\nThe Commission\u2019s market survey clarified that L gas and H gas do not have the same characteristics or properties and that certain manufacturing processes, in particular in the chemical industry, require the use of H gas. Facilities designed for L gas cannot process H gas, and vice versa, without expensive prior modification of the combustion systems. Moreover, regarding the customers connected to the distribution network, the decision to switch from one type of gas to another is not up to the final customers, because that would suppose that their distribution network manager made the decision to supply the entire network with the new type of gas. Regarding the ability to substitute one gas for another, it has already been said that major investments would be necessary to convert H gas into L gas (and vice versa) and to modify the facilities of final customers. This greatly reduces the substitutability of both supply and demand.\nSimilarly, a CREG study concluded that L gas and H gas are interchangeable to a limited degree only and that competition and access possibilities on the two markets are substantially different.\nUsing the \u2018small but significant non transitory increase in price\u2019 (SSNIP) test, the study confirms that the substitution costs on the demand side would be prohibitive. For industrial customers, the costs consist of installing new pipelines, and for distribution networks, of inspecting and adapting facilities. Regarding substitution costs on the supply side, the study notes the high operating costs of the conversion plants and the absence of sufficient substitutability on the supply side.\nThese considerations clearly argue in favour of distinguishing between L gas and H gas in all supply markets for final customers."

        "text": "A gas-trading hub is a liquidity instrument that provides services to facilitate exchanges between actors on a market. Schematically, a hub facilitates trade between gas buyers and sellers, enabling them to find, in the short term, sufficient volumes of supplies or to sell excess capacity.\nA gas hub can be linked to a physical installation as in Zeebrugge, Belgium. Gas flows are connected to and pass through this point. A hub can also be virtual; one then speaks of a notional point. Such a hub, which has no precise geographical location, makes it possible to trade gas arriving in a given zone. The National Balancing Point (NBP) hub in the United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub in the Netherlands are examples.\nAs acknowledged by the parties in their notification, trading on the Zeebrugge hub constitutes a product market distinct from the other gas markets in Belgium. It operates differently from the supply markets. Supply is used to satisfy the demand of final customers or retailers based on fixed-term contracts and at a location generally chosen by the customer; on the hub, however, there is a more immediate meeting between the supply and demand of the various traders. This results in transactions whereby the gas is normally delivered to the hub. In addition, trading at the hub differs notably from supply to retailers in that generally all the traders act as buyers and sellers. Another characteristic making the Zeebrugge hub unique are the arrangements governing access to the hub, which is currently via the transit network (rTR/vTn). In 2005, all nominations towards the hub were made through the transit network, while less than 4% of the volumes nominated from the hub went through the transmission network, with the remainder going through the transit network."

Moreover, the electricity plants are often directly connected to the transmission network, which distinguishes them from the small industrial and commercial customers and from the residential customers who are connected to the distribution network. Electricity producers can be distinguished from the large industrial customers by their consumption profile: whereas the large industrial customers have a relatively stable demand throughout the year, electricity plants\u2019 demand is subject to greater variation, particularly in function of the season. Consequently, electricity producers have flexibility needs different from those of other final customers. These factors are also reflected in the answers to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire: a majority of respondents consider the market for the supply of gas to electricity producers distinct from the other markets."

Accordingly, large industrial customers generally obtain lower prices and are often connected directly to the transmission network.\nThe parties propose making a distinction between large industrial customers and small industrial and commercial customers based on an annual consumption threshold of 1 million m3 (12 GWh). They maintain that this threshold for distinguishing between the largest gas consumers and other consumers is present in Belgian gas legislation: the Gas Law and the Walloon and Flemish decrees on the organisation of the gas market. These legal instruments are said to have used the threshold of 1 million m3/12 GWh to adjust the timetable for liberalisation of the gas supply market. A significant number of respondents to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire agree with the threshold proposed by the parties.\nThe CREG proposes making a distinction between large industrial customers and other customers based on their connection to the transmission or distribution network. However, the approach proposed by the parties and that of the CREG agree in so far as both approaches regard large industrial customers as a category of customer significantly different from other types of customer. When evaluated according to the CREG\u2019s criteria (connection to the transmission network), the market is smaller than when evaluated according to the criteria proposed by the parties (annual consumption higher than 1 million m3). This also corresponds with certain answers received by the Commission during the market survey, according to which the threshold of 12 GWh proposed by the parties is too low.\nNevertheless, the data provided by the CREG on the basis of its definition of the market largely confirm the data provided by the parties regarding the actors present in the market for large industrial customers and their respective market share. For these reasons, it is not necessary to decide exactly where the threshold is in order to regard a customer as a 'large industrial customer'. For the purposes of this Decision, the competition analysis will be carried out on the basis of the threshold proposed by the parties. The Commission considers that the results of this analysis would be substantially the same using the market definition adopted by the CREG."

        "text": "In its previous decisions, the Commission examined whether there was a separate product market for the supply of gas to household customers but left the question open. Under Belgium\u2019s current regulatory framework, only household customers in Flanders are eligible. Household customers in Wallonia and Brussels are not yet eligible and must currently purchase gas from their local authority utility. This situation will change when the market is completely liberalised on 1 January 2007 in Wallonia and the Brussels Region.\nIn Flanders, the market for household customers was liberalised on 1 July 2003, at the same time as for other customers. It appears, however, that competition in this market has developed differently from in other supply markets, including the market for small industrial and commercial customers. According to the figures provided in the notification, Suez (via ECS) acquired a considerably higher market share of (Flemish) household customers [70-80%]* than small industrial and commercial customers [60-70%]*. This is mainly due to the major role played by the default suppliers (in particular ECS), to which all former customers of the local authority utilities who had not chosen any supplier were transferred once they became eligible. It appears that many more small industrial and commercial customers changed supplier than did household customers.\nEven though the gas supply markets for household customers in Wallonia and Brussels are not yet open to competition, a prospective analysis should take into account the probable effects of the proposed transaction on these markets, for which the date of 1 January 2007 has already been set for liberalisation. In these two regions, the lag between the liberalisation of supply to small industrial and commercial customers (1 July 2004) and to household customers demonstrates that two distinct markets already exist. Moreover, the default suppliers to household customers in these two regions will be determined by the local authority utilities, which could create further differences.\nFor these reasons, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, the market for H gas supply (with the exception of Brussels, where household customers are supplied exclusively with L gas) and the market for L gas supply to household customers are markets distinct from the other gas supply markets."

        "text": "In the parties\u2019 view, the Zeebrugge hub in Belgium, the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility in the Netherlands are part of the same market.\nAccording to the parties, these three hubs are already very interconnected since their areas of influence largely overlap. Thus, they say, the Dutch (TTF) and British (NBP) networks are connected to the Belgian transmission and transit network (Zeebrugge). The parties also point out that the NBP and Zeebrugge hubs are directly connected to each other, since they are located at either extremity of the Interconnector (connecting Zeebrugge and Bacton, UK), the capacity of which is being increased.\nIn addition, the three hubs will be even more closely inter-linked when the BBL gas pipeline between the Netherlands (Balgzand) and the United Kingdom (Bacton), scheduled for late 2006, opens.\nThe parties would also highlight the convergence of prices seen between these hubs. Any fluctuations in prices, according to them, have been within a narrow band. Cases where prices at the hubs have diverged significantly could be resolved rapidly, notably by major infrastructure investments.\nFinally, the parties point out that the gas exchanges at these three hubs are all operated by APX Gas. APX, an independent Dutch company, created a subsidiary, APX Gas, which since 2004 has been electronically managing gas transactions at the NBP, TTF and Zeebrugge hubs (through APX Gas Zeebrugge B.V., in which APX and Fluxys subsidiary Huberator are shareholders). APX Gas can monitor transactions on the three hubs, using a single application and on a single screen.\nIn its statement of objections, however, the Commission expressed doubts concerning the parties' hypothesis of a single market comprised of the three hubs. The mitigated results of the market survey indicated that, although prices at these three hubs partially correlated with each other and often fluctuated in the same direction, significant price differences between the hubs persisted, in particular during the winter of 2005-06. Moreover, in its statement of objections the Commission pinpointed insufficient transmission and transit capacity and the resulting constraints as the principal obstacle to establishing a 'geographical link' between the three hubs.\nRegarding the NBP and Zeebrugge hubs in particular, the statement of objections referred to a detailed analysis prepared by British regulator Ofgem. Ofgem had analysed prices, including transmission costs, during the period January 2000 to April 2006. The analysis showed that, on 17% of the days during this period, the difference in prices between the NBP and Zeebrugge was greater than 7.5% i.e., the approximate costs of using the Interconnector.\nIn their reply to the statement of objections, the parties cited notably the 'obvious' convergence of prices between the Zeebrugge and NBP hubs since 2004. The parties attribute the price differences observed by Ofgem to start-up problems at the Zeebrugge hub. According to the parties, 'this situation [of differences during the Zeebrugge hub\u2019s initial phase] is over, because a net increase in liquidity at the hub has been noted in later years, as has a better interconnection between the two hubs following the extension of the Interconnector'.\nThereafter, the Commission again consulted Ofgem and asked it to carry out the same analysis for the last 24 months, i.e., the period July 2004 - June 2006. That analysis showed that the difference between the price at the NBP and the price at the Zeebrugge hub was greater than 7.5% on 8% of the days during this period. There is thus increasing convergence between the prices at the two hubs, in particular in comparison with the four previous years. However, Ofgem also reproduced an analysis of price differences at the three hubs: NBP, Zeebrugge and TTF. Ofgem observed that prices at the three hubs diverged significantly during certain periods, in particular during the winter of 2005-06. Ofgem\u2019s data show that the differences between the TTF and the two other hubs are much more pronounced than the differences between the NBP and the Zeebrugge hub.\nBased on the parties\u2019 reply and its own complementary investigations, the Commission agrees that prices at the NBP and Zeebrugge are increasingly converging. This convergence will likely continue, given the plans to increase the Interconnector\u2019s capacity. According to Ofgem, the extension of the interconnection between Belgium and Great Britain should, if the markets function in a competitive manner, result in increased convergence of the markets and less divergence, because constraints on transmission will be reduced.\nOfgem rightly states that differences in prices may be due to causes other than limits on capacity, in particular the various balancing arrangements. The Commission\u2019s complementary investigation revealed that the Belgian balancing regime, despite displaying certain elements of hourly balancing, comes very close to the daily balancing used in the United Kingdom.\nIn the statement of objections, the Commission identified another probable cause for the price divergences between the NBP and the Zeebrugge hub, namely the control exercised by Distrigaz & Co. over the infrastructures linking the Zeebrugge hub with the Belgian network and with other pipelines and the resulting access difficulties for other operators. This obstacle will be eliminated, however, by the remedies proposed by the parties. The commitments proposed by the parties with a view to increasing the hub's liquidity and thereby reducing the barriers to entry to the Belgian gas markets provide for the transfer of the marketing rights for the transit network (which connects to the hub) to Fluxys and submission to the Code of Conduct.\nIn the light of the above, the Commission concludes that competitive conditions on the Zeebrugge and NBP hubs have considerably converged and it expects this convergence to continue owing to the commitments facilitating access to the hub. For the purposes of this Decision, these two hubs can therefore be regarded as belonging to the same market. However, the Commission concludes that the TTF does not form part of this same market in view of the price differences which, compared with the Zeebrugge hub and the NBP, are more frequent and more significant than between these two hubs."

        "topic": "Markets for the supply of gas",
        "text": "In accordance with the decisions of the Commission and the Belgian Competition Council, the parties consider that the various markets for the supply of gas to eligible customers in Belgium operate at the national level.\nHowever, in the aforementioned ECS/Sibelga decision, the Commission left open the question whether the various supply markets in Belgium were national or regional in nature.\nSimilarly, in its recent GDF/Centrica/SPE decision, the Commission found that all gas supply markets in Belgium were national in nature. However, regarding the market for the supply of gas to household customers, the Commission discussed the possibility of a regional dimension (Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels Region) while leaving the question open. It cited differences in regulatory conditions, which were not homogeneous across the regions, in particular as regards the opening of household customer gas supply to competition.\nThe Commission\u2019s market survey provided some indication that the household customer market should be considered regional. Firstly, each of the three regions has different regulations regarding the supply of gas to household customers. These differences also include different dates for opening the market to competition. Moreover, the three regions attach varying importance to L gas for supply to household customers. For example, household customers in the Brussels Region are supplied almost exclusively with L gas, while the remainder of the country is supplied with H or L gas according to the location of the final user.\nSecondly, opening up the household customer markets in Wallonia and the Brussels Region will probably lead to a gradual alignment of competitive conditions in the three regions, as was the case with the other customer categories. That would demonstrate that these markets had a national dimension. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this Decision it is not necessary to decide whether the household customer markets are national or regional, because the notified merger would impede effective competition significantly whatever market definition is used.\nIn conclusion, the relevant gas markets in Belgium affected by the notified transaction are: \n\u2022 Market for the supply of gas to electricity producers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to dealers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to large industrial customers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to small industrial customers (national) \n\u2022 Markets for the supply of H and L gas to household customers (national or regional).\nIf these markets were to be considered regional, the relevant product market would include only L gas in the Brussels Region."

In previous decisions the Commission has also defined a wholesale gas market using criteria similar to the CREG\u2019s. In their reply to the decision under Article 6(1)(c) the parties contest the existence of a wholesale market other than the market for gas supply to retailers. However, the parties acknowledge the importance of the question of access to gas resources for operators active in markets further down the line. In fact, regardless of whether a wholesale market is defined in the strict sense of the term or the matter is considered from the point of view of access to gas, the notified merger would undeniably lead to an overlap between the parties\u2019 activities at wholesale level or at the level of access to gas."

        "text": "Furthermore, the Commission investigated whether it would be appropriate to distinguish between different types of glass coatings, based on their end-use applications, i.e. automotive glass coatings, flat glass coatings, and container glass coatings . The Commission also investigated whether a distinction based on the form of glass coatings i.e. dry glass coatings a nd liquid glass coatings, could be warranted and, finally, whether it would be appropriate to single out the manufacture and supply of forehearth colourants. The results of the market investigation and corresponding Commission\u2019s assessment are set out bel ow.\nOn the demand -side, a majority of competitors and customers alike indicated that customers would not be able to use the various types of glass coatings interchangeably . A majority of customers indicated , accordingly , that they would not be able to switch from one type of glass coating to another , because notably of the differences existing between the application process es (as each type of coating is applied to a specific type of glass, requiring different types of machinery) , the characteristics of the products (formulation of the glass coating itself require different types of additives depending on the end -application ), as well as their specific products requirements (resistance to scratching, heat etc. required b y customers varying significantly between each type of end -application) . A customer explains for example that the flat glass coating industry is typically simpler in terms of application abilities requirements (e.g. spray, roll, coated on) than the automo tive industry which is more sophisticated in terms of the techniques used.\nOn the supply -side, competitors pointed out certain similarities in the raw materials used and the production process of each end -applications, despite stressing differenc es in product features and know how. Customers also consistently noted that the production processes and the underlying technology largely varie s depending on the end -use application. Furthermore, the results of the market investigation were mixed in rel ation to the c ompetitors \u2019 ability to switch production between the various types of glass coatings in a relatively short timeframe and without incurring significant costs . While some competitors indicated that they would be in a position to switch producti on and would do so in case of a change in market conditions, others indicated that they would not have this ability.\nIn this respect, the Commission notes that the market investigation highlighted that the Parties\u2019 competitors do not focus the core of th eir activities on all three types of end-use application consistently, but they rather specialise in one or two areas and they tend to have limited activities in the other ones. A competitor also indicated that prices differ also from one type of end -use application to another. For example, coatings for automotive glass tend to be more expensive than non -automotive coatings, although in some instances, for example for some niche applications involving precious metals, non -automotive glass coatings may also be expensive.\nIn light of the above, the Commission leaves open the question as to whether it is necessary, to distinguish, within the manufacture and supply of glass coatings, some separate markets according to the end -use application i.e. automotive glass coatings, flat glass coatings, and container glass coatings."

        "text": "In relation to the possibility to distinguish glass coatings according to their form, i.e. between liquid glass coatings and dry glass coatings, the Commission first notes that the manufacturing process of dry and liquid glass coatings slightly differs .\nHowever, according to the information provided by the Parties, dry glass coatings is only an intermediate product in that glass coatings must in any event be applied by glass manufacturers in liquid form , so that they are largely substitutable . Dry glass coatings are mixed with a liquid medium used as an input for the preparation of liquid glass coatings. As such, customers of dry coatings are either distributors or end customers which mix dry glass coatings at their own premises, for resale or own purposes use.\nAccordingly, dry glass coatings constitute only a marginal part of the supply of glass coatings overall. In addition , on the basis of the data provided by the Parties, the Parties and virtually all competitors supply liquid glass coatings for the main end -applications, i.e. automotive, flat glass and container glass.\nThese observations were confirmed in the course of the market investigation. A minority of competitors indicated that they supplied glass coatings in dry form in the EEA and, even when they did, such competitors indicated that dry coatings only accounted for a minimal proportion of their supply.\nAs to distributors exercising an intermediary role \u2013 consisting in sourcing dry glass coatings from manufacturers and transforming it into liquid glass coatings to resell to customers \u2013 the results of the market invest igation results suggest that their activity is negligible. Only half of competitors and a minority of customers are aware of the presence of such distributors on the market, and these players are considered to only be able to supply very limited volumes.\nIn light of these elements, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to distinguish glass coatings according to their form, and that dry and liquid glass coatings should be considered altogether within each and every relevant markets ."

The manufacture and supply of this product appears as a niche activity. O nly one competitor of the Parties indicated to be active in the manufacturing and supply of this product and a minority of customers source it.\nFurthermore, based on the information provided by the Notifying Party, container glass coati ngs can be applied to glass using different m ethods. The first method is an on-glass method which applies the coatings t o the surface of glass product. The second method is the in -glass method, which changes the colour of the entire glass material and not only the surface of the glass container. The i n-glass colouring can be achieved using both traditional glass coatings and forehearth colourants. As a result, traditional glass coatings and forehearth colourants differ in their application process but deman d for glass coatings applied on the surface of a container and forehearth products used in -glass typically come from the same customer groups and competitors are in a position to switch between forehearth coatings and other glass coatings in response to a change in price of either product.\nIn light of these elements, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to distinguish forehearth colourants from container glass coatings."

        "text": "The Notifying Party submits that the geographic market for the manufacture and supply of porcelain enamel coatings is at least EEA -wide in scope, if not global. The reasons put forward a re the following: (i) manufacturers supply porcelain enamel to customers globally from a single or from a limited number of manufacturing sites ; (ii) there are large cross -border trade flows within the EEA and far beyond (in particular, between EMEA and APAC), and transport costs are negligible; (iii) customers tend to procure products globally and in a centralised fashion ; (iv) manufacturers do not face material regulatory barriers or meaningful tariffs limiting trade ; and (v) there are no regional differe nces in product and technical characteristics.\nIn those cases related to various types of coatings, while ultimately leaving the exact geographic market definition open, the Commission considered that the scope of most of these pr oducts is at least EEA -wide, if not global .\nIn the present case, the results of the market investigation indicated that the relevant geographic scope of the market for the manufacture and supply of porcelain enamel coatings could be EEA -wide, possibly with the addition of Turkey , due to the reasons outlined below .\nWithin the EEA, porcelain enamel manufacturers are subject to the same EU regulatory framework ( REACH \u2013 Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), therefore, acro ss the EEA, under a regulatory standpoint, conditions of competition are rather homogenous . Additionally, customers highlighted the existence of price differences between the EEA and other regions of the world and indicated transport costs and geographical proximity to their suppliers\u2019 manufacturing plant as elements playing a role in their choice of a supplier of porcelain enamel coatings . In terms of transport costs, the majority of customers observed that, while transport costs represent 0 -5% of the tot al price of the product when the supplier is EEA -based, they represent 5 -10% of the total price of the product when the supplier is based outside of the EEA and supplies EEA -based customers. In terms of geographic location, certain customers claim that it is essential that technical experts working for porcelain enamel coatings\u2019 supplier s be in close contact with their customers , as they might be asked to intervene at their customers\u2019 production sites at short notice, should a technical issue occur. The va st majority of customers indicated that they source the largest part of their porcelain enamel coatings needs at EEA -wide level and, to a more limited extent, they source their needs from Turkish suppliers , which are considered by the majority of customers as credible as EEA -based suppliers .\nIn light of the elements set out above, the Commission deem s it appropriate to define the geographic scope of the market for porcelain enamel as EEA-wide and, potent ially, including Turkey. The Commission , however, considers that the question relating to the precise scope of the geographic market for porcelain enamel coatings can be left open since the competitive assessment would not materially differ under any plausible market definition.\nFor the purpose of the present case, the Commission will carry out its competitive assessment on the overall market for the manufacture and supply of porcelain enamel coatings at EEA -wide level and in the alternative regional market including the EEA and Turkey ."

Furthermore, all competitors which contributed to the market investigation indicated that the competitive strength of their company, of t he Parties, as well as of other glass coatings suppliers varies across geographic regions.\nThird , customers also highlighted that the geographic location of suppliers and their proximity are important criteria to select a supplier, pointing towards a n EEA-wide geographic market scope. A customer for both automotive glass and flat glass explains for example that it is very important that the facility of its supplier is located close to his, to reduce transports costs as well as for security of supply, which is a critical point in the industry. According to another customer, having a regional supply base is a key requirement for automotive glass coatings customers, as it allows to reduce risks associated with transport and ensures availability of technical and customer support at short notice.\nWith respect specifically to flat glass, cu stomer s explain that lead times are particularly important in this area, as contracts tend to be short and supply be carried out on a project -by project basis.\nOn the basis of the elements set out above, the Commission considers the appropriate geographic scope for the market for the manufacture and supply of glass coatings overall, and all plausible narrower markets to be EEA -wide."

For example, one of Ethniki\u2019s rivals notes that accident insurance policies \u201care based on a different philosophy [than health insurance policies, they] are intended to meet other needs and generally, [they] are simpler and mor e economical in terms of premiums \u201d.

In addition, s everal health insurer respondents indicated that customers purchase insurance policies offering cash payments for accidents or critical illness as a complement to health insurance products.\n(24) From a supply -side perspective, the market investigation also confirm s that health insurance services are not substitutable with accident and critical illness insurance policies . For health insurance services, insurers often negotiate with healthc are providers regarding the fees of the various medical servic es and in case of treatment, the insurer pays directly the contracted healthcare provider.

This is the case for the following reasons.\n(43) First , the vast majority of private hospital providers submit that i n case of service quality decrease in a private hospital in Attica, patients would only consider alternatives in Attica. One of the competitors of HHG states : \u201cthe geographic market for priva te healthcare services [is] Attica-wide and not national [\u2026] the catchment area of private hospitals in Athens is the wider Attica region .\u201d Another rival adds: \u201c it is highly unlikely [for] citizens \u2013 patient s to travel outside Attica for hospital care. Traditionally the best quality of care in terms of... private facilities and doctors are located in [the] Attica region \u201d.\n(44) Second , health insurance providers who often cover claims for general private hospital services also indicate that private hospitals do not compete across regions of Greece and that private hospitals in Attica compete with each other. One of Ethniki\u2019s competitors submits: \u201c customers based in Athens and Thessaloniki seek treatment in Athens and Thessaloniki respectively. [Our] customers who live in other parts of Greece without good public hospitals in close proximity may source healthcare services in Athens or Thessaloniki \u201d. Another rival of Ethniki adds : \u201c[p]olicyholders who reside in Athens or Thessaloniki will seek healthcare in Athens or Thessaloniki, respectively. Exceptionally, policy holders who reside in areas close to Athens... or in the islands will come to Athens for healthcare services .\u201d\n(46) Four th, the Notifying Party submits that [90-100]% of Ethniki \u2019s insured patients residing in the Attica region select a private hospital in the Attica region. [60-70]% of Ethniki \u2019s insured patients residing outside the Attica region also select a private hospital in the Attica region. The Notifying Party considers that this supports the existence of a \u201c national (albeit Attica -centric) market for private general hospitals \u201d. However, the fact that many patients travel to Attica from other regions of Greece to seek treatment does not mean that the relevant geographic market should be defined at national level. Instead, this fact confirms that private hospitals in Attica ha ve \u201c... the highest level of care in Greece, have the most capacity, the shortest distance for the largest population in Greece, and the largest doctor selection \u201d. For these reasons, private hospitals in Attica do not compete with private hospitals in ot her regions of the country.\n(47) Fifth, contrary to the Notifying Party\u2019s claims, most of the private hospital respondents in the Commission\u2019s market investigation indicate that they are active only in one region (and typically, in Attica). But even considering the few competitors who operate hospitals in more than one regions, their activities do not support a national geographic market definition for general private hospital services. For example, HHG operates five hospitals in Attica an d one in Crete (Creta Interclinic). In its internal strategy document for FY2021, HHG indicates that Creta Interclinic should focus on demand of tourists and local population in Crete and thus, it would not compete with hospitals in Attica. Another exam ple of a private hospital service provider which operates hospitals in and outside Attica is Athens Medical Group (\u201cAMG \u201d). AMG operates five hospitals in Attica and one in Thessaloniki (Interbalkan Medical Centre). During the Commission\u2019s market investiga tion, AMG submitted: \u201c private hospitals outside Attica do not exert any competitive pressure on private hospitals in the Attica region ... the catchment area of Attica -based hospitals still does not span beyond the Attica region ...\u201d."

As such, mobile harbour cranes are appreciated by customers, often in smaller ports, which deal with various cargo types but are less common in larger ports specialising in the handling of shipping containers where other crane types are more suitable. This has been evidenced in the market investigation where the majority of customers have indicated that , if they needed to replace one of their existing mobile harbour cranes, they would most likely replace it with another mobile harbour crane rather than another type of crane.

However, in view of the results of the market investigation and in line with its past decisional practice, the Commission considers that a segmentation of in-flight catering services by type of flights (short/medium haul vs long haul) is not warranted."

In that respect, the Notifying Party itself submits that in-flight equipment services are generally not tendered by airlines together with in-flight catering services \u201c but generally tendered separately and independent of in-flight catering services contracts \u201d. The airlines tend to purchase in-flight equipment services centrally and then make the in-flight equipment products available to the in-flight caterer that \u201cwill be in charge of handling the equipment\u201d and bring it on-board. The Notifying Party\u2019s submission was confirmed by the majority of customers during the market investigation. The majority of airline customers purchase the in-flight equipment services themselves and subsequently make the equipment products available to their in-flight caterer. The majority of airline-customers that purchase other services than in-flight catering (such as in-flight equipment services) do not typically purchase in-flight catering services and other services together from one single supplier. Often, even different components of equipment services are tendered individually. The majority of customers also indicated that they have no problem with purchasing in-flight catering services separately from other services such as in-flight equipment services, citing flexibility, greater choice, better prices as well as quality of products offered as the main reason for sourcing these other services separately from in-flight catering.\nSecond, contrary to the Notifying Party\u2019s claim, the majority of in-flight caterers do not provide in-flight equipment services as ancillary services to their core business, or only to a very limited extent. None of the Parties\u2019 in-flight catering services competitors are among their main competitors with regards to the provision of in-flight equipment services.\nIn view of the above considerations, for the purpose of this decision, the Commission considers that equipment services are not ancillary to in-flight catering services and constitute a relevant separate market. The question whether equipment services should be segmented by type of customers can be left open, as the Transaction is unlikely to raise competition concerns with respect to the market for equipment services, even on a plausible narrower market for in-flight equipment services."

Regarding the segmentations according to (i) the type of packaging (between carton and aseptic PET) and (ii) the production process (between aseptic and non -aseptic, as well as between ambient and chilled), the results of the market investigation confirms previous findings that they are separate product markets. Indeed, the majority of the upstream competitors who expressed an opinion on these points consider that is difficult in terms of costs and time involved to change between types of packaging and between ambient and chilled production processes. Regarding the potential segmentation between the production and bottling of organic and non- organic NABs, the majority of upstream competitors that responded in the market investigation at this point consider that is reasonably easy to switch the production from organic juice to non- organic juice and vice versa. The majority of market participants indicated that the main difference between the production and bottling of organic and non- organic NABs relates is the certifications needed for the raw material to be classified as of organic origin. In relation to private label and contract manufacturing of NABs, a large majority of upstream competitors indicated that suppliers active exclusively in the production and bottling of private label NABs to retailers are able to start contract manufacturing for brand owners swiftly and without significant costs. The opposite is also true according to the upstream competitors: suppliers active exclusively in the contract manufacturing of NABs are able to start contract manufacturing private labels for brand owners swiftly and without significant costs. In any event, for the purpose of the present case, in line with the Commission\u2019s precedents and considering the Target is only active in the sale of branded fruit juices, the assessment will be done at the narrower plausible level, i.e. considering branded contract manufacturing as a separate market from the production and bottling of private label NABs."

        "text": "In previous decisions, the Commission considered whether to distinguish between residential and non -residential customers in the market for the retail supply of fixed telephony services. While the Commission left the precise scope of the market for the retail supply of fixed telephony services open in several decisions, it found in recent decisions that such a market does not contain further segmentations and that the overall product ma rket for fixed telephony services includes fixed telephony services provided over the Internet Protocol (Voice -over-IP or \u201cVoIP \u201d services ).\nThe majority of the competitors respond ing to the market investigation agreed that the market for fixed telephony services encompasses the retail provision of fixed telephony services both through fixed telephony lines and through VoIP services. The market investigation did not provide a clear indication as to whether a distinction between local/national and international calls is appropriate. The Commission observes tha t the use of fixed telephony (in minutes), both for domestic and international calls has been consistently decreasing over the years, with the volume (in minutes) of international calls being less than 2% of the total usage. In parallel, all market players sell multiple -play bundle for a comprehensive fee including their individual services. The Commission therefore does not consider that a separate market exists for local and international calls. \nThe results of the market investigation are mixed when it comes to a potential distinction of the market between residential and non -residential customers. The explanations provided by about half of the respondents point to a distinction existing between the two categories. In fact , it has been explained , non-residential customers, in particular medium and large enterprises , have different requirements from residential customers , in terms of products and quality of services, and for this reason are supported from different departments/personnel of telecommunicatio ns service providers. It has also been observed that service s and prices applicable to the two categories differ and that , both on the demand and on the supply side , residential and non -residential customers can not be co nsidered as part of the same market One respondent, on the other hand , points also to similarities between the two categories, both in terms of demand and supply characteristics. At the same time, t he same respondent explains that, notwithstanding such similarities, residential customers ar e more likely to buy fixed services as part of multiple -play bundles. The Commission considers that such preference for multiple -play offers excludes supply side substitutability between the two services, as suppliers of services to business customers are not necessarily able to provide multiple -play offers to residential customers, with a nation -wide reach, like suppliers of residential customers are typically able to do. \nIn light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this Decision, the relevant product market is the market for the retail supply of fixed telephony services including VoIP services. With respect to a possible distinction between residential and non -residential (business) customers , the Commission considers that t he market definition can be left open, as this distinction does not affect the outcome of the assessment . The Parties, in fact, have limited activities in the segment including large business customers and the Transaction does not lead to an affected marke t in that respect."

It rather considered that fLTE services should be included in the overall market for retail mobile telecommunications services.\nIn line with the Notifying Party\u2019s submission and the results of the market investigation, the Commission considers that it would be appropriate to co nsider an overall retail market for the supply of fixed internet access services, including all product types, distribution modes and speeds/bandwidths, to residential and SOHO customers, but excluding fLTE.\nIn fact, w ith regard to fixed internet access se rvices provided through mobile network infrastructure, the respondents to the market investigation confirmed that fixed broadband internet access services are not substitutable with mobile broadband access services, because of differences, primarily in pri cing models , but also because of the ir different uses. Internet access via mobile networks is designed with mobility as a key feature, which greatly affects bandwidth and data transmission , as compared to fixed internet access services . Further, mobile access does not have the same levels of reliability and stability, as the speed of the networks depends on the network that covers the area where the end user is located. As to supply -side substitutability between fixed internet access and fLTE, a respond ent to the market investigation explains that mobile operators in Greece are in the process of deploying 5G. It is possible that, o ver time, these next -generation mobile services will bring significant improvements to the broadband services offered via mob ile connections including high -speed access and very hi gh network capacity. As such , 5G services have the potential, depending on location, to pose a greater competitive constraint on fixed broadband. However, limitations will remain and the expansion of 5G will be gradual and will not ensure, at least for the time being, homogeneity in supply.\nWith respect to a possible distinction by customer type, most respondents to the market investigation took the view that fixed internet access services provided to residential and SOHO customers , on the one hand, and large business and government customers , on the other hand , belong to separate markets. This is because, according to the respondents , the interchangeability between the two services is not perfect. Also, the requirements and purchase processes of larger business customers for fixed or fixed -mobile services are usually materially different (e.g. they may use tender or other competitive procedures) . The Commission further notes that, also from a supply side perspective, there is no perfect substitution between the services provided to the two categories. In fact, a provider supplying services to residential and SOHO customers could (at least in theory) switch to supplying large business customers. The r everse, however, could be more difficult, as supplying residential customers would require an extended network with a vast footprint, which not all suppliers of large business and government customers might have.\nThe Commission, therefore, concludes that services provided to residential customers and SOHO customers, on the one hand, and to large business and government customers belong to separate product markets.\nIn light of the above, the Commission considers that, for the purpose of this Decision, the relevant product market is the market for the retail supply of fixed internet access services, including all product types, distribution modes, and speeds/bandwidth, to residential and SOHO customers, excluding fixed internet access services provided t hrough mobile network infrastructure."

Transcription software for healthcare should be considered as a separate product market from transcription software in other areas as suppliers of transcription software for healthcare would offer products that are deeply integrated with the workflow of healthcare providers and the specific applications they use, like the electronic health records (\u201c EHRs \u201d).

The Dragon Professional product can be used in a number of sectors . The \u201cbase\u201d of products offered by Nuance outside of healthcare would essentially be the same. Depending on the customer\u2019s needs and preferences, Nuance works with the individual customer to customise the software and map commands that match specific workflows (including specific linguistic requirements) , rather than implementing significant differences in its products between sectors outside healthcare . Nuance\u2019s focus on certain sectors is a commercial decision having identified sectors with use cases for its products.\n\nThe Notifying Party considers that the relevant market for transcription software outside healthcare includes both transcription and voice control accessibility solutions. While the transcription and accessibility functionalities differ, the same speech recognition technology that powers transcription can be used to power accessibility. The two functionalities are also offered together as part of the same Dragon software.\n\nIn addition, the Notifying Party argues that the lines between the two functionalities are blurred. What can be defined as accessibility functionality also includes transcription functionality. A user can command the OS to open a certain application (i.e., an accessibility function) and then continue to use the application with their voice, transcribing the voice input into text (i.e., the transcription function), relying on the same Dragon software. For instance, they could direct the OS to open their email application and then dictate the content of the email."

The superiority of one solution over another will depend on customer-specific factors, such as resource and timing constraints, design goals, and issues specific to the customer\u2019s industry. An out-of-the-box solution enables customers (such as hospitals) to use the feature immediately, with the software provider managing the quality, robustness, and enhancement of the feature.

Concretely, the market investigation showed that post -separation and LWP sorting in fact take place at different levels of the waste management value chain, with post -separation being a necessary intermediary step before LWP sorting when no source -separation is being carried out.35 Moreover, the Parties admit that post -separations services are subject to different contracts than LWP sorting .36 Respondents to the market investigation ha ve confirmed that operators of post -separation facilities do not com pete for LWP sorting contracts and, vice -versa, LWP sorters do not compete for post -separation contracts .37 As a result,  post-separation services do not compete with LWP services.

        "text": "The Notifying Party has explained,59 and the market investigation has shown, that demand for the sorting of LWP i s national, as the chain for the recycling of LWP is organised at the national level.  European Union Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste (\u2018 the Packaging Directive\u2019 ) requires Member States to take necessary measures to e nsure that systems are set up for the collection and recycling of packaging waste . These systems must be open to the participation of economic operators. Member States however have discretion regarding the manner in which they choose to implement this obli gation, and schemes implementing the Packaging Directive vary by country in their design and scope. Under the Dutch \u2018extended producer responsibility\u2019 regime , which implements the Packaging Directive,60 producers and importers of packaged products are legal ly responsible for the prevention, collection and recycling of packaging waste. Such companies, when they are above a certain size, must register with Afvalfonds Verpakkingen (\u2018 Afvalfonds \u2019),61 and pay a fee to Afvalfonds according to the volumes of packaging they place on the market. In exchange, Afvalfonds takes over their responsibility for the recycling of packaging waste. Nedvang BV (\u2018 Nedvang \u2019, formerly \u2018VPKT \u2019) is the fully-owned subsidiary of Afvalfonds that ensures the practical implementation of the extended producer responsibility principle, both directly by contracting for the sorting and recycling of packaging waste, and indirectly by compensating other bodies that arrange for sorting and recycling.   Moreover, the composition of LWP to be sorted and the manner in which collection of waste is organised varies from country to country. For instance, Dutch LWP typically has a higher plastic content that LWP originating in Germany, where plastic bottles are partly covered by a deposit scheme and recovered separately.62 These differences have a decisive impact in the sorting process , as explained in Section 4.2.2.2(D).  In short, demand for LWP sorting services is structured nationally, based on national rules governing the legal responsibility for the collection and sorting of LWP . As such, in the following section,  the Commission will assess the competitive conditions for the supply of LWP sorting services to customers  in the Netherlands, where the Parties\u2019 activities overlap."

        "text": "The supply of LWP sorting services  to Dutch customers  appears to be limited by a number of factors, in particular distance from the plant to collection point, customer preferences, composition of LWP and national regulations, although t his does not prevent some facilities located  in Germany from  also sort ing LWP  from the Netherlands . Concretely, of the approximately 450kt of Dutch LWP sorted in 2020, around 1/3rd was sorted in plants in Germany located close to the Dutch border (with the farthest plant being situated 150km from the border in driving distance).  In order to identify the area in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous , the Commission will assess the barriers that exist for the sorting of LWP  from the Netherlands , as identified by the market investigation. The following factors are relevant for this assessment: first, transport costs significantly limit the distance which LWP can travel to reach an LWP sorting plant. Second, environmental costs are taken into account as  customers try to avoid transporting LWP for sorting over long distances to minimize the associated CO 2 emissions. Third, beyond transport and environmental costs, LWP sorters broadly report that customers have a preference for keeping  waste within the country. Fourth, due to the specific LWP composition and quality requirements, technical adjustments are required for a German (or Belgian) plant to be able to sort also Dutch LWP. Fifth , sending LWP for sorting outside the  Netherlands involves more administrative formalities than sorting the LWP with in the country."

Respondents pointed out that the customers for th e two services are different, as for laboratory services for clinical development the customers are pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, or CRO service providers, while for laboratory services for diagnostic purposes the customers are physici ans or hospitals. The required footprint is different as well \u2013 laboratory service providers for clinical development typically have few laboratories globally (PPD has eight), while for diagnostic purposes a more regional presence is required. Respondents also pointed out that d ifferent accreditations and standards apply , and that instruments are more easily substitutable in diagnostics laboratories as there is not the same criticality associated with consistency of testing results and patient data. Therefore, while they may employ some of the same testing methods, the Commission considers that laboratory services for diagnostic purposes and laboratory services for clinical development (i.e. laboratory services in the context of clinical trials and complian ce with pharmaceutical GMP ) constitute separate product markets."

In PKN Orlen / Grupa Lotos, the Commission considered that on- motorway fuel stations (including those located on toll and non -toll motorways and expressways) likely constituted a distinct market segment in Poland, but as the evidence was not clear -cut, the Commission left the exact market definition open. However, the Commission has in two cases ultimately decided against such segmentation in view of the particularities of those cases (such as the non -existence of tolls or insignificant price differences)."

        "text": "Regarding a possible segmentation between the retail supply of motor fuels to B2B customers and to B2C customers, the Commission defined sales with the use of fuel cards as B2B sales and sales without the use of fuel cards as B2C sales, since sales to B2B customers without the use of fuel cards are undistinguishable from sales to B2C customers. Fuel cards are issued by fuel station operators, such as the Parties, and (international) fuel card providers such as DKV and UTA, who act as intermediaries between fuel station operators and fuel card holders (B2B customers). In PKN Orlen / Grupa Lotos , the Commission concluded that a segmentation between sales to B2B customers and to B2C customers (based on the use of a fuel card, where fuel cards are merely tools used to provide a differentiated offer to B2B customers ) was appropriate because of the different price setting/levels (with B2C customers always paying the local pump price, whereas B2B customers receive discounts on the local pump price or they negotiate a rebate on a spot price set at national level), and the diverse needs of both groups of customers. In particular, B2B customers have different requirements relating to the network coverage of their motor fuel suppliers, including putting more importance than B2C customers on a network having a significant number of on -motorways stations. In addition, the features of fuel cards can include additional services such as toll payments, or online tools for managing company fuel use as well as payment conditions , and B2C customers do not normally have access to fuel cards."

        "text": "The Notifying Party considers that it is not warranted to segment the game publishing market based on genre or type of games. As regards game genres, the Notifying Party considers that genre classification is subjective and gamers play different genres on the basis of their personal preferences. From a supply-side perspective, a studio can create games of different genres, or involving elements of multiple genres. As regards game types, the Notifying Party submits that there is some evidence of a low degree of demand-side substitution between AAA games and non-AAA games. This is because AAA games offer more complex gameplay features and mechanics, as well as a longer play time. Moreover, there may be also low supply-side substitution from non-AAA games to AAA games, based on the budget and technological innovation that the development of AAA games requires. This would make it burdensome for small studios to switch from non-AAA to AAA games. However, the Notifying Party also puts forward that boundaries between AAA and non-AAA games are blurred and subjective. Gamers may play various game types according to their preferences and regardless of the status of the game. Furthermore, certain games initially developed as non-AAA games have become successful and highly regarded over time, involving an increasingly higher budget and larger development teams. At the same time, some games developed on an AAA budget were not considered as such by gamers. In addition, the Notifying Party considers that a segmentation of the market according to other possible game types (stand-alone games, browser games, free-to-play and freemium games), as well as by type of gamer (e.g., hardcore vs casual gamer) is not warranted. In any event, the Notifying Party submits that the exact product market definition can be left open for the purpose of assessing this Transaction."

However, in the Daimler/BMW/Car Sharing JV  decision, in light of the supply -side substitutability in that specific case, the Commission conducted its assessment on the basis of an overall leasing market combining operational and financial leasing. \nWhile the characteristics of the two types of leasing can vary, in general the primary objective of a fina ncial leasing contract is the financing of the acquisition of a vehicle, leading to ownership of the vehicle by the lessee, whereas in the case of an operational leasing contract it is the use of the vehicle and therefore it has some elements in common wit h a rental contract. \nOn one hand, a  financial lease is a financial product that functions as a loan by the lessor to enable the lessee to purchase a v ehicle and pay in instalments. Therefore, in a financial lease contract it is generally the lessee that bears the operational and residual value risk of the vehicle.  \nOn the other hand, i n an  operational leasing  contract , the economic and legal ownership of the vehicle  remains with the lessor  and the lessee pays monthly instalments for its use .
