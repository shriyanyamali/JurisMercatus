        "text": "In past decisions, the Commission considered that each of the markets for the supply of cat food and dog food could be further segmented: (i) between dry food, wet food and snacks and (ii) between branded products and products for private labels at the wholesale level. However, the Commission considered that different quality categories of pet food were not deemed to form separate relevant product markets. The outcome of the market investigation in the present case confirmed the Commission\u2019s previous decisions. The results of the market investigation confirmed that dry food, wet food and snacks should be considered to belong to different product markets. On the demand side, dry food is less expensive and can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration, while wet food offers higher hydration and palatability particularly for pets with specific health needs or preferences. Snacks are generally used as treats, but do not provide a balanced nutrition and therefore cannot substitute dry or wet food. On the supply side, these products are manufactured on distinct production lines with entirely different technical processes and dedicated packaging. The results of the market investigation also confirmed the relevance of a segmentation between branded product and products for private labels at the wholesale level. On the demand side, these products address clearly distinct use cases for retailers: the formulation and packaging of products for private labels are customized to the specific retailer and are labelled with the retailer\u2019s own brand, while branded products feature the supplier\u2019s own brand and are made available to several retailers in the same format. On the supply side, although the same production lines can in principle be used to produce both branded products and products for private labels, the supply base in these two segments is significantly different. This is because the main suppliers of branded products (such as Mars and Nestl\u00e9) are large, sophisticated conglomerates focusing on the promotion of their own brands and are not active (or no longer active) in the supply of products for private labels. Conversely, producers for private labels are generally smaller in size. And even if some of them also offer a range of branded products, this offering is often rather marginal and in any case much smaller than the abovementioned branded suppliers. With respect to quality categories, the results of market investigation confirmed that, although consumers often have a preference for one or the other quality tier, these different categories exist in a continuum and respondents were not able to indicate clearcut criteria demarcating the boundaries of each segment. Moreover, most suppliers producing pet food of different quality categories do so on the same production lines with no or minor adjustments to the manufacturing process. Therefore, in line with its past decisions, in the present case the Commission assessed market shares for the supply of cat and dog food at wholesale level distinguishing between dry food, wet food and snacks and between branded and private label products."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s past decisions concluded that the relevant geographic market is national in scope for branded products and larger than national (and possibly EEA-wide) for private label product at the wholesale level. This difference stems from the fact that private label products are not advertised by their supplier, as any advertising for private label products is done by the retailer. Producers may therefore afford higher transport costs and still offer the product at competitive prices compared to the branded pet food. Therefore, manufacturers of private label can competitively sell such products throughout an extensive area, which is wider than national. Moreover, some international hypermarket chains tend to carry out their procurement policies for private label purchases in a context which is wider than national. In the present case, the large majority of responding suppliers indicated that their European plants are able to deliver their branded and private label products in most of the EU territory and even to other continents. The large majority of responding retailers similarly indicated that they are able to procure branded and private label products from producers located in most of the European territory. In any event, the geographic market can be left open, because the transaction does not raise any concerns even under the most conservative approach (i.e. assuming a national scope of the relevant markets)."

The market investigation in the present case confirmed this conclusion. From the point of view of the upstream producers (which is particularly relevant in this case), the different distribution channels are seen to a large extent as interchangeable, because producers supply the same products across channels with no or minor adjustments. Suppliers also explained that they are able to shift volumes among different channels in response to changes in market demand. Also from the point of view of downstream consumers, grocery and specialist outlets are seen as competing against each other and consumers often buy products in both channels. The Commission\u2019s precedent (dating back to more than 20 years ago) did not mention sales on online platforms. The market investigation in the present case showed that customers easily switch between online and brick-and-mortar shops and suppliers increasingly pursue omni-channel strategies that span both online and offline sales. The Commission therefore considers that the overall market for the retail of pet food also includes online sales."

These agreements thus provide the legal basis for a global integration of the companies\u2019 networks and commercial policies. Furthermore, the scope of and rationale for these agreements go beyond the bundle of routes between Germany and their respective home countries.

According to the majority of both customers and suppliers MCC is not, or only to a limited extent substitutable for other excipients (such as lactose), as MCC has unique chemical properties and substitutes such as lactose are often not substitutes as there is a trend to providing lactose-free formulas. The market investigation also indicates that there may be a segmentation between MCC for pharmaceutical and MCC for nutraceutical applications. On the one hand, MCC for pharmaceuticals may have a price premium that makes it uneconomical to use it in nutraceuticals. On the other hand, MCC for nutraceuticals can only be used in pharmaceuticals if it complies with a pharmacopoeia such as the European pharmacopoeia. While the production process for both types of MCC is similar, there is a stronger emphasis on quality control and consistent quality for MCC for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, there may be limited substitutability between MCC for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, but the results of the market investigation are not entirely conclusive on this point, as the production process for all types of MCC is similar and there is an overlap of certain grades being used for both applications, which speaks in favour of not segmenting the market by end-application."

Further, the market investigation supports a possible further segmentation of the FCU market according to: (i) intended use (i.e., residential vs non-residential FCUs), (ii) based on the number of tubes (i.e., FCUs with two tubes and FCUs with four tubes) and (iii) design (i.e. classical FCUs that are free standing on the floor and non-classical FCUs that are mounted in the wall or ceiling).

Size and capacity of FCUs are the most cited distinguishing factors, with residential FCUs normally being smaller in size and having a lower heating/cooling capacity than non-residential FCUs. In terms of capacity, some respondent suggested that residential FCUs could be < 8kW and non-residential FCUs > 8kW. It was also mentioned that FCUs for residential use are \u2018quieter\u2019, \u2018thinner\u2019 and with better aesthetics (having excellent finishes and being made by metal sheets rather than plastic). Internal documents of the Parties appear to support a segmentation based on intended use. In addition, a due diligence report refers to a \u2018residential ventilation segment\u2019.

The Commission has considered further potential segmentations within non-carbonated soft drinks (namely fruit juices, energy and sport drinks), but has ultimately left this question open.

In the present case, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition can be left open. If dilutables were part of the wider market of soft drink (either carbonated or not, depending on the beverage mixed with the dilutable), no affected markets would arise in relation to these products.

Accordingly, a maximum of 12 daily slot pairs (i.e. the corresponding departure and arrival slots) are available for all the Relevant City Pairs considered together and within that overall limit, a maximum of five daily slot pairs are available for the Identified Long-haul City Pairs and for the London-Nice city pair.\n\nPursuant to Clause 1.1.2 of the Commitments, the number of daily Frequencies available to operate a service on the Identified City Pairs was increased from the original five daily Frequencies to seven daily Frequencies as the two slot pairs provided by IAG to Transaero were returned to IAG at the end of IATA Summer Season 2015. Therefore, at the beginning of the IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, 14 daily slot pairs were available, including seven daily slot pairs for the Identified City Pairs.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, slot pairs were granted to Aeroflot to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2017, slot pairs were granted to Flybe Group Plc (\"Flybe\") for the operation of 25 weekly Frequencies (up to four daily Frequencies) on the London-Edinburgh route and 18 weekly Frequencies (up to three daily Frequencies) on the London-Aberdeen route. For IATA Summer Season 2018, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of one additional weekly Frequency on the London-Aberdeen route (on Sunday) and two additional weekly Frequencies on the London-Edinburgh route (one on Saturday and one on Sunday). Also for IATA Summer Season 2018, Aeroflot was awarded additional slot pairs to operate seven additional weekly Frequencies (one additional daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2019, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of seven weekly Frequencies (i.e. one daily Frequency) on the London-Edinburgh route. For IATA Summer Season 2020, the remaining slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of four additional daily Frequencies on weekdays and on Sunday on the London-Edinburgh route and five additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Edinburgh route; and two additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Aberdeen route.\n\nTherefore, following the Summer 2020 Slot Award Decision, no Slots remained available under Clause 1.1.1(b) of the Commitments.\n\nFollowing Flybe\u2019s entry into administration on 5 March 2020, IAG (via British Airways) served notices to terminate its slot release agreements with Flybe on 5 March 2020 and clawed back the Slots that had been made available and were operated by Flybe pursuant to the Commitments. In total, IAG clawed back slots allowing 84 weekly frequencies.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, the Commission adopted a decision pursuant to Clause 1.3.3 of the Commitments granting Grandfathering rights to Flybe with respect to the Slots granted to it in the Flybe Summer 2017 Slot Award Decision (\"the Flybe 2017 Slots\"; concerning 43 weekly Frequencies).\n\nGiven that (i) a total of 98 weekly Frequencies are to be made available pursuant to Clauses 1.1.1 and 1.1.2; (ii) 14 weekly Frequencies were granted to Aeroflot; and (iii) Flybe has been granted Grandfathering rights with respect to 43 weekly Frequencies, 41 weekly Frequencies remained.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2021/2022, slot pairs were granted to Saudi Arabian Airlines (\"Saudia\") to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Riyadh route. For IATA Summer Season 2022, no Slots were released to applicant airlines. For IATA Winter Season 2022/2023 slot pairs were granted to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air France to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Nice route.\n\nTherefore, for IATA Summer Season 2023, 27 weekly Frequencies are still available under Clause 1.1.1."

        "text": "The relevant product market comprises scheduled passenger air transport services. The analysis focuses on city-pair markets for flights to and from London Heathrow airport (\"Heathrow\"), which is recognised as a highly slot-constrained airport. The Commission\u2019s assessment concentrates on the routes identified within the Commitments, specifically including London -Aberdeen, London -Edinburgh, London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow. The Commitments distinguish between \"Identified UK City Pairs\" (London -Aberdeen and London -Edinburgh) and broader \"Identified City Pairs\" (the latter including the UK pairs as well as London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow). The geographic market is primarily defined narrowly, as flights operating to and from Heathrow only. This focus arises from the congestion and slot constraints at Heathrow, which is the central concern addressed by the Commitments. An analysis of wider markets, including London \"three\" (Heathrow, Gatwick, City) and London \"five\" airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, City, Luton, Stansted), was considered. However, the Commission\u2019s decision and remedies are aimed at addressing competition effects specifically at Heathrow, as highlighted in recital 58 of the Decision and in line with precedent decisions. The term \"London -Moscow\" is interpreted within the scope of the Commitments as Heathrow -Moscow, not encompassing Gatwick. While Gatwick services exist, they were not part of the competition concerns at the time of adoption of the Decision, and hence do not affect the scope of the committed slot releases. The Market Definition section therefore recognizes the relevant markets as scheduled passenger air transport services on the specified city-pairs operating out of Heathrow airport, on which the competitive dynamics and remedies are focused."

However, the results also indicate that the propulsion technologies used in each are fundamentally different.\nAs regards a potential distinction according to the sector in which FCSs are used, the results of the market investigation suggest that the market for the manufacture and supply of FCSs could be segmented according to different end -use applications (e.g., automotive, stationary applications, construction equipment, forklifts, trains, ships) . While some respondents indicate d that currently there may be a certain degree of supply -side substitutability, respondents also indicated that, as the market matures, the differences between FCSs for different applications will be greater.\nIn light of the above, for the purposes of th e present decision, the Commission considers that it can be left open whether the market for the supply of FCSs may be further segmented according to the sector in which FCSs may be used since the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compati bility with the internal market or the functioning of the EEA Agreement , under any plausible product market definition.

        "text": "With respect of a possible distinction of CRM software solutions based on functionality , the market investigation indicated that there may be  a separate market for the CRM software functionality of customer service and support, whic h also corresponds to a distinction used by Kustomer itself, as well as in third party reports, such as Gartner. From a demand -side perspective, a strong majority of responding market participants (both CRM software providers and business customers) cons idered that CRM software with different functionalities are complementary rather than substitutable and that customer service and support CRM software is the only type of CRM software functionality that is substitutable for Kustomer\u2019s CRM software product . The majority of CRM providers that expressed a view considered it would not be technically possible (or at best only to a limited extent), nor would it be likely from a commercial perspective, for business customers to switch to other CRM software funct ionalities (i.e., other than customer service and support CRM software) in a scenario where the price of customer service and support CRM software increased. From a supply -side perspective, while larger CRM software providers may offer a range of differen t functionalities, smaller players (such as Kustomer) may only offer one or a limited number of functionalities. There was no clear consensus among CRM providers on the ability for a company specialised in other functionalities to start offering customer s ervice and support CRM software in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs . While in the Phase I market investigation, a  majority of respondents that expressed a view said that this  would not be possible in the short term and with out incurring significant investment costs, in the Phase II market investigation, the results were mixed, with several respondents indicating that it would depend on the CRM software provider\u2019s existing capabilities (e.g., existing technology and know -how). In light of the above , the Commission  concludes that, from a demand side perspective, there is a separate market for customer service and support CRM software. To the extent the market would be  wider than customer service and support CRM software, this would thus only be due to supply -side substitutability arguments (i.e., a CRM software provider offering another functionality starting to offer customer service and support CRM software). However , the Commission considers that any CRM software provider active in another segment wanting to start offering customer service and support CRM software would require B2C communication channels as an input, as customer service and support CRM by definition requires interaction with customers, and that the mere fact that some CRM software providers offer multiple functionalities does not establish full supply -side substitutability if starting to offer a different functionality cannot necessarily be done in the short term and without incurring significant investment costs."

There was no consensus between business customers that expressed a view on whether on- premises and cloud- based CRM software solutions are substitutable for one another. From a supply -side perspective, the majority of respondents that expressed a view considered that it would not be possible for a CRM software provider specialised in on -premises solutions to start offering cloud- based CRM solutions in the shor t term and without incurring significant investment costs. However, the market investigation also indicated that a majority of CRM software customers use cloud- based solutions, and most CRM software providers only or primarily offer cloud- based solutions. One market participant indicated that \u201c companies that specialized in on- premise s solutions have or are moving towards offering cloud- based solutions \u201d and a leading CRM software provider  confirmed that it \u201c offers only cloud- based solutions .\u201d The same is  true of Kustomer. Indeed, the majority of respondents that expressed a view also indicated that cloud -based CRM software solutions are either progressively replacing on- premises solutions, or have almost entirely done so. In light of the mixed market inv estigation results and the fact that the majority of the market already appears to be cloud -based/SaaS, the Commission considers that it is not necessary to segment the broader CRM software market or the narrower customer service and support CRM software m arket between SaaS/cloud based solutions on the one hand and on- premises solutions on the other hand. However, the precise segmentation can be left open as the Commission  considers that it is likely, and there is even a strong probability, that the  Transaction would significantly impede effective competition  in both an overall market for customer service and support CRM software and a potential segment for cloud- based customer service and support CRM software solutions (as well as on the broader CRM software solutions  market  and a potential segment for cloud- based CRM software solutions)."

Second, there is a difference in pricing conditions as consumer communications apps are mainly offered for free.

Furthermore, market participants have generally confirmed that prices for MDA are negotiated and set at national level . As one market participant explained, \u201c[w]e have separate agreements for each country. Suppliers have separate organisation in each country \u201d. The fact that these negotiations take place at a national level is fully reflected by the fact that there exist significant price differences between EEA countries . Internal data from the Parties show significant price variations among EEA countries, for similar MDA models. For example, for washing machines, internal data from the Target shows that prices among EEA countries can vary as much as [\u2026]% from the average price .

Thirdly, the market investigation has revealed (i) the importance of brands for the purchasing patterns of final customers and (ii) that brands have varying importance from country to country. For example, one market participant highlighted: \u201cMDA are long-lasting products (i.e., a life cycle of 10-20 years for MDA) and customers thus tend to turn more to brands which they know and trust \u201d. Furthermore, brand positioning is not homogeneous from country to country. Some brands have a higher positioning in some countries, while being much less important in other countries.

As one market participant explained, this segmentation is \u201crelevant because the solutions for each sub -market will in some cases vary from sub-market to sub -market .\u201d Another market participant considered that \u201c[t]his proposed subsegmentation is closer to the business. As an example, different segments have different regulations that impact directly in the quality and the cost o[f] the services. \u201d In contrast, a competitor considered that the segmentation is not warranted, since \u201c Clients expect BPO service providers to offer wider functionality across the client's business activities .\u201d \n\nFinally, a majority of respondents who expressed a view, considered that there exists a separate product market for CXM BPO services. One competitor respondent even stated that \u201c CXM BPO services are not comparable to IT services. Although it has an IT element to it this is in a supporting and enabling role and is not the main driver of focus of CXM services.\u201d Some customer respondents explained that managing a customer contact centre is a specific line of business, requiring specific business capabilities, which only partially overlap with the business capabilities / competences to run other outsourced services (such as IT support/maintenance, financial management)."

The respondents set out that it could only be viable if the operator has its own passive network close to the area where it uses active services and at the same time, it could serve/reach a certain level of customer density and access to passive services would be available. Moreover, some participants mentioned high switching costs , especially in case of migrating between wholesale service providers (e.g. de-activation and activation fees) and time needed for network deployment on the part of the access seeker (indicated to be from several months to more than a year).

The respondents highlight that operators would lose their investment (capex) in own active equipment as the sunk costs would not be recovered when using wholesale active access services instead. Furthermore, in such a case, the operators would face higher operational costs (opex) of active services as well as losing a possibility to differentiate more their services from that of the wholesale service provider as in case of using passive access services with own active equipment. In essence, it would go against the principle of the \u201cladder of investment\u201d. In addition, most market participants suggest there are regulatory differences between access to active and passive services. For example, the respondents state that at the time of their reply, there was no access obligation for TIM to provide FTTH passive wholesale access products (except in PNRR areas), while there was an access obligation to provide active services and those services were subject to cost orientation regulation."

The market investigation strongly supports that there is no demand side substitutability between lactase and other enzymes as the large majority of responding customers and of competitors consider that it is not possible to substitute lactase with another enzyme. As explained by a respondent: \u201cenzymatic activities are highly specific and unique to a substrate. Lactases specifically convert Lactose to Galactose and Glucose, on this basis the same enzymatic process could not be achieved using an alternative enzyme\u201d.\nThat is supported by a number of elements indicating limited supply side substitutability. In order to produce lactase, a manufacturer needs to have the relevant technology (a lactase enzyme and production host), the manufacturing capacities, distribution network and regulatory approvals required to manufacture and commercialise the product.\nAs a result, a majority of responding competitors and distributors consider it would take more than 2 years for a company already active in the manufacture of food and beverage enzymes to start producing and commercially supplying GM produced lactase and an investment \u201c between 10-50 million EUR if the company also has to build infrastructure and team; less than 10 million EUR if the company already has such resources \u201d. In all likelihood, given the similarities in the manufacturing process, similar investments would be necessary to start producing and commercially supplying non-GM produced lactase.\nAs a result, the Parties\u2019 argument on supply side substitution are only applicable to players that already have all the relevant technology, infrastructure, and approvals. Given the above, the Commission considers that there is a separate market for the manufacture of lactase."

Selection is most frequently driven by regulatory requirements to comply with organic certification, or company policy related to the use of GM derived ingredients/process aids \u201d.\nAccordingly, there are two types of lactase customers:\nCustomers bound to use non-GM produced lactase because they need a certain certification; for these customers, the Commission considers that there could be a market for non-GM produced lactase only. As the Parties do not overlap for non-GM produced lactase, this potential market is not considered further.\nCustomers that can use both GM produced and non-GM produced lactase interchangeably.\nThe Commission\u2019s investigation revealed that while this second group of customers can technically use either non-GM or GM produced lactase, there are indications that non-GM places a limited competitive constraint on GM."

Beyond that range, performance varies \u201d. A customer adds that : \u201cdespite their differences, you can compensate a low level of activity of a certain lactase by increasing the quantity used. However, using a higher quantity can impact the taste and texture of the product as well as the overall price \u201d.\nThis is supported by submissions of the Parties on the activity profile of various lactases at different temperatures and pH levels that show that the activity level indeed varies between lactases, with some performing better than others at a given temperature or pH. However, as confirmed by the Parties, that can be compensated by increasing the dosage of lactase used.\nOn this basis, the Commission considers that, with regard to end use, this is a market of heterogeneous products for which it is not appropriate to segment the market for lactase according to end use or performance level in different pH or temperature levels."

Not each factor was considered for each type of pharmaceuticals.\nThe market investigation has confirmed the Commission\u2019s decisional practice with respect to the product market definition of animal pharmaceuticals.\nIn particular, the vast majority of market participants responding to the market investigation agreed that: (i) animal pharmaceuticals form a product market distinct from animal biologicals and feed supplements, (ii) animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by different animal groups (CA, PA and possibly equine), and that animal pharmaceuticals should be segmented by therapeutic areas.\nHowever, within a specific therapeutic area, various animal pharmaceuticals are not generally considered substitutable, as they are used for treatment of different indications. A veterinary pharmaceutical intended for a specific indication generally cannot be used for treatment of a different indication. For example, a Dechra product used for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s disease would not be substitutable with a treatment for Addison\u2019s disease even though both treatments belong to the field of endocrinology. Therefore, there is not always demand -side substitution for the various pharmaceuticals within a given therapeutic area.\nIn addition, market participants confirm that players active in an individual therapeutic area typically do not offer an entire portfolio of products in that area , and thus the competitive landscape for different indications even within a therapeutic area can differ considerably. Supply -side substitution is thus not immediate between various pharmaceuticals belonging to a given therapeutic area.\nIn view of the above, for the purposes of this decision, the Commission considers it appropriate with respect to the assessment of vertical links between the Parties, to use the markets for animal pharmaceuticals across therapeutic areas as a starting point for the identification of affected markets but has based the more detailed assessment on the upstream markets for animal pharmaceuticals for each individual indication and/or for a specific animal group. Further differences between animal pharmaceuticals for a specific indication or animal group (which have an influence on the pool of available alternatives) based on the factors identified in paragraph (15) above, are taken into account in the Commission\u2019s competitive assessment."

Although some treatments can only be offered by larger clinics (which can be referred to as animal hospitals), this does not undermine the fact that there is direct competition across the range of veterinary clinics, individual veterinarians and \u201cone vet clinics\u201d.\nIt is not appropriate to distinguish the provision of veterinary clinics depending on the type of animal (CA, FA or equine) for the purposes of the current case (even though there may be variations depending on geographic location). This is because all veterinarians can offer their services regardless of the type of animal.\nIn any event, the Notifying Party states that the product market definition can be left open as the Transaction would not give rise to competition concerns under any plausible market definition."

        "topic": "Veterinary clinics geographic market definition",
        "text": "The Commission has not in the past assessed the geographic delineation of the market for the provision of veterinary clinics. In a previous case, while not defining such a market, the Commission recognised that the retail of dietetic pet food via the veterinary channel could be national in scope or even local.\nThe Notifying Party does not contest that the geographic scope for the provision of veterinary services could be defined as local if the closeness of competition between providers of veterinary services were to be examined. It, however, notes that for the purposes of the Transaction, its effects should be assessed at a national level for veterinary services. This is because the Transaction gives rise to a vertical link between Dechra and IVCE, where the former predominantly distributes its pharmaceuticals through national wholesalers. The Notifying Party therefore does not believe it is appropriate to assess the Transaction based on a narrower geographic delineation.\nThe market investigation suggests that the provision of veterinary services could be either national in scope or local, depending on the type of clinic. As regards primary care clinics, most respondents to the market investigation considered that an animal owner would be willing to travel a distance of maximum 20km. As regards referral clinics, nearly all of the respondents consider that animal owners would travel at least around 50km to a referral clinics, with most of them suggesting that animal owners would travel above 200km. Some market participants explain for exa mple: \u201cFor more advanced procedures carried out in referral clinics, [\u2026], customers might travel across all of Finland for one specific clinic\u201d, and \u201cwhen a referral takes places, the pet owners are willing to travel very far to see the specialist (this could include long distances by car, and even taking flights)\u201d.\nGiven that the Transaction gives rise to vertical links only, and that the procurement of animal pharmaceuticals is in general managed by distributors and clinics on a national basis . This is supported by the fact that a majority of respondents to the market investigation considered that clinics generally have a purchasing strategy at national level, and even, bigger chains tend to have a multi -national / EEA -wide purchasing strategy with national components. Therefore, Dechra, or any animal pharmaceutical company, when dealing with veterinary clinics in a specific country, would typically negotiate the agreement with a centralised (at least) national procurement function of a specific clinic or groups of clinics. Therefore, any attempt of foreclosure strategy of the Merged Entity, i.e. preventing or worsening access to Dechra\u2019s pharmaceuticals, would have to be conducted on a national level. As a result, for the purposes of the vertical assessment in this case, the Commission considers it appropriate to carry out its assessment at a national level."

Furthermore, they argue that the Commission may leave open the ques tion of whether the following segmentations may be appropriate:\nSegmentation according to the type of production process used, between grey, blue, and green hydrogen.

The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, but argue that at least low -carbon and renewable hydrogen are part of the same market because (i) the production processes are similar (the key difference being the source of the electricity used), (ii) preference of customers, especially in the mobility sector, for low -carbon and renewable hydrogen, as a way to decarbonise the sector, and (iii) the fact that most hydrogen suppliers will be offering a mix of both low -carbon and renewable hydrogen to their customers in the coming years.\nSegmentation according to the hydrogen\u2019s application or end use, betwee n hydrogen used in industrial applications, energy sector, and mobility. The Parties argue that the Commission may leave this question open, noting however (i) the nascent nature of the new decarbonised hydrogen uses and (ii) the role that blue and green hydrogen are intended to play in the decarbonisation efforts in the mobility sector."

Most of the surveyed hydrogen customers replied that both types of hydrogen are substitutable because both have the same composition, characteristics, and limited or no CO2 emissions. However, some respondents point ed out that , because green hydrogen does not directly emit CO 2, contrary to blue hydrogen, public subsidies are typically granted for the production and supply of green hydrogen and, moreover, customers increasingly prefer to source this type of hydrogen instead of blue hydrogen. One hydrogen supplier participating in the Commission\u2019s investigation qualified blue hydrogen a s a \u2018temporary solution\u2019 with \u2018 no long- term future \u2019. The Commission\u2019s investigation is also inconclusive on the need to distinguish between low -carbon and renewable hydrogen. Considering, however, the similar composition and characteristics of both types of decarbonised hydroge n, the fact that both emit limited or no CO2 emissions, as well as the small dimension and nascent character of the market for both types of decarbonised hydrogen, the Commission considers that there are currently no robust indications that the de carbonise d hydrogen market should be segment ed between (i) green and blue hydrogen or (ii) low -carbon and renewable hydrogen."

Most hydrogen suppliers, however, consider that no segmentation is warranted, as the composition of the hydrogen is the same and there are no reasons, from a technical, quality, production, or logistics perspective, to ju stify the identification of separate markets based on different end uses. In any event, as described in paragraphs (24) and (25), the mobility sector represents insignificant volumes of the total hydrogen demand in the EU. Because of that , as well as the fact that , from a technical and quality perspective, there are no major differences in the technical composition of hydrogen for different end uses, the Commission considers that currently there are no robust indications that it is appropriate to segment these markets based on end uses."

The Commission notes however that there are several obstacles for light vehicles to use HRS designed to service HDV . Indeed, an HRS servicing HDV will mainly be equ ipped with 350- bar pumps while current models of light vehicles require 700- bar pumps. Moreover, HRS servicing HDV are likely (i) to be located closer to logistic hubs than to residential areas and urban centres , (ii) to have station layout s dedicated to H DV drivers ( in terms of , e.g., height and size of the canopies) , and (iii) to use HDV -specific refuelling dispenser technology.

        "text": "The Commission has not yet considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV.\nHowever, t he Commission has previously considered the geographic scope of the market for the retail supply of motor fuels. In that context , contrary to the retail sale of motor fuel products for B2C customers which may take place both at a national and local level, sales to B2B customers are essentially national because fuel card s are issued for national consumption, with prices either set nationally or with a fixed reduction to the local price and covering a nation- wide network of petrol stations.\nThe Parties consider that, unlike the traditional fuel retail markets, which are l ocal in scope, in the market for the retail supply of hydrogen to HDV competition exists between operators at an earlier point in time and at a European level, or at least national level , for the following reasons:\nFirst, competition between HRS operators does not take place at the refuelling location since there is no spontaneous decision- making by the truck driver during his or her journey. Instead, the journey of a hydrogen truck driver will be carefully planned with a clear idea from the onset on where and when to refill at a n HRS. Competition between HRS offerings takes place at an earlier stage, when transporters compare available solutions and enter into a contract with a n HRS operator (either at project developer stage, or when already operational), when it is in the process of transitioning its fleet to hydrogen and needs to be reassured about the viability of the network for its trucks, or when it has already transitioned its fleet to hydrogen.\nSecond, B2B customers travel large distances intern ationally with HDV on a larger fuel autonomy. These vehicles typically have a range of 500 to 800 km with the technology currently available, and several HDV manufacturers are hoping to increase this range beyond 1000 km by 2030. Liquefied hydrogen technol ogy, which is currently under consideration for 2026/2027, could contribute to extending truck autonomy beyond 1000 km. As a result, a network of HRS for HDV could be spread over a large area and across multiple countries.\nThird, the JV\u2019s main customers will be major stakeholders with Europe -wide needs. [\u2026]. As a result, these international customers negotiate conditions at a supra -national level with international retail operators, [\u2026]."

The market investigation showed that transporters do not generally spontaneously decide to refuel. When asked to explain, respondents noted \u2018 the limited number of stations available today \u2019.

In some cases, it has assessed the impact on the markets for trading and clearing derivatives together, but in other more recent decisions has considered them separately.\nAs regards commodi ty derivatives, the Commission considered a distinction between trading services provided for soft and hard commodity derivatives, as well as even narrower definitions based on the underlying asset such as cocoa derivatives, coffee derivatives or sugar der ivatives. It has not previously assessed how this would apply to power derivatives.\nIn previous decisions specifically relating to the operation of trading platforms for power derivatives, the Commission has found that services facilitating the spot (i.e. short -term, physical) trading of electricity is a separate product market, distinct from services facilitating the financial (i.e. long -term, derivative) trading of electricity.\nRegarding execution environment, the Commission has not assessed in detail the scope of the relevant product market for services facilitating the financial trading of electricity, though it noted that brokers\u2019 activities (i.e. OTC bilateral trades) could potentially be included in this market, while leaving this question open.\nRegarding type of contract, in its previous decisions relating to the operation of trading platforms for power derivatives, the Commission has not previously considered whether the relevant product market should be segmented by type of contract. H owever, it has considered this question while assessing the trading (by customers of the platforms such as energy generators or traders) of power derivatives in the Nordics.

Clause 1.3.1 o f the Commitments refers to the purpose of the Slot Commitment s, which is to restor e competition on the Relevant City Pair(s) by establishing  a Competitive Air Service .\nAs regards  the context of the Commitments, the Commission considers that , as explained in paragraph (63) above, Grandfathering rights constitute an incentive for the Prospective Entrant to operate the Relevant City Pairs . To entice entry by a competitor, the Prospective Entrant needs clear and verifiable  principles, as well as legal certainty, notably concer ning the award of Grandfathering rights, in order to decide whether or not to apply for the Slots. This in turn requires that the Prospective Entrant can trust that the criteria for obtaining Grandfathering rights (i.e. appropriate use and obligation to ex clusively operate services on any European Short -haul City Pair or the Identified Long -haul City Pairs ) are clearly circumscribed and not subject to arbitrary considerations."

Consequently, when applying a literal interpretation of the concepts used in the Commitments, the appropriate use of the Slots should be understood as the absence of Misuse of these Slots.\nMisuse is defined in Clause 1.3 .5 of the Commitments, w hile \u201c appropriate use \u201d is not defined. The existence of a definition of \" Misuse \" and the absence of a definition of \" appropriate use \" in the Commitments points towards a  correlation between \" appropriate use \" and \" absence of Misuse \". Since Misuse of the Slots is deemed to arise under a number of circumstances listed in Clause 1.3 .5, a situation which does not give rise to Misuse can , a contrario, be considered as \u201cappropriate use \u201d of the Slots.  By making  refer ence to  a concept which is defined in the Commitments, this interpretation is the only one which  would provide the Prospective Entrant with sufficiently clear and verifiable guidance and which would fulfil the requirements of legal certainty ."

        "text": "In its practice, the Commission has traditionally defined the relevant market for scheduled passenger air transport services on the basis of the \"point of origin/point of destination\" (\"O&D\") city-pair approach. Such a market definition reflects the demand-side perspective whereby passengers consider all possible alternatives of travelling from a city of origin to a city of destination, which they do not consider substitutable to a different city-pair. As a result, every combination of a point of origin and a point of destination is considered a separate market. In the past, the Commission has also taken into consideration supply-side elements such as network competition between airlines based on the hub and spoke structure of traditional carriers. However, the Commission considered that the degree of supply-side substitutability between different O&Ds remains limited. It considered in this respect that, although from a supply-side perspective a network carrier could in theory fly from any point of origin to any point of destination, in practice network carriers build their network and decide to fly almost exclusively on routes connecting to their hubs.\n In line with the Commission's notice on market definition, the Commission has given pre-eminence to demand-side substitution, whereby it considered that customers still need the transportation from one point to another and that competition still takes place on an O&D city-pair basis (even though some customers, in particular corporate customers, may have concluded corporate agreements for a range of routes and the commercial advantages stemming from such agreements may lead them to prefer one airline among the different airlines that operate on the route). It has thus traditionally upheld the O&D approach."

Traditionally these two groups of passengers have been labelled as time sensitive (\"TS\") and non-time sensitive (\"NTS\") passengers, respectively.\n In light of the above, the effects of the Transaction will be assessed on the narrowest possible markets, namely on a market for TS passengers and on a market for NTS passengers."

        "text": "The level of substitutability of indirect flights to direct flights largely depends on the duration of the flight. As a general rule, the longer the flight, the higher the likelihood that indirect flights exert a competitive constraint on direct flights.\n When defining the relevant O&D markets for air transport services, the Commission has considered in previous decisions that with respect to short-haul routes (below 6 hours flight duration) indirect/one-stop flights generally do not provide a competitive constraint to direct/non-stop flights absent exceptional circumstances (for example the direct flight does not allow for a one-day return trip, or the share of indirect flights in the overall market is significant). The Commission has sometimes distinguished mid-haul routes, which are routes of more than three hours where direct flights normally do not provide the option of one-day return trips, so that indirect flights may be able to compete with direct flights. With respect to long-haul routes (more than 6 hours flight duration), the Commission has considered in the past that indirect flights constitute a competitive alternative to direct services under certain conditions (for example if they are marketed as connecting flights on the O&D pair in the computer reservation system).\n The question of the substitutability of direct and indirect flights, which is relevant for flights from London to Riyadh and Jeddah, will be examined in the competitive assessment of these routes."
