        "text": "In past decisions, the Commission considered that each of the markets for the supply of cat food and dog food could be further segmented: (i) between dry food, wet food and snacks and (ii) between branded products and products for private labels at the wholesale level. However, the Commission considered that different quality categories of pet food were not deemed to form separate relevant product markets. The outcome of the market investigation in the present case confirmed the Commission\u2019s previous decisions. The results of the market investigation confirmed that dry food, wet food and snacks should be considered to belong to different product markets. On the demand side, dry food is less expensive and can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration, while wet food offers higher hydration and palatability particularly for pets with specific health needs or preferences. Snacks are generally used as treats, but do not provide a balanced nutrition and therefore cannot substitute dry or wet food. On the supply side, these products are manufactured on distinct production lines with entirely different technical processes and dedicated packaging. The results of the market investigation also confirmed the relevance of a segmentation between branded product and products for private labels at the wholesale level. On the demand side, these products address clearly distinct use cases for retailers: the formulation and packaging of products for private labels are customized to the specific retailer and are labelled with the retailer\u2019s own brand, while branded products feature the supplier\u2019s own brand and are made available to several retailers in the same format. On the supply side, although the same production lines can in principle be used to produce both branded products and products for private labels, the supply base in these two segments is significantly different. This is because the main suppliers of branded products (such as Mars and Nestl\u00e9) are large, sophisticated conglomerates focusing on the promotion of their own brands and are not active (or no longer active) in the supply of products for private labels. Conversely, producers for private labels are generally smaller in size. And even if some of them also offer a range of branded products, this offering is often rather marginal and in any case much smaller than the abovementioned branded suppliers. With respect to quality categories, the results of market investigation confirmed that, although consumers often have a preference for one or the other quality tier, these different categories exist in a continuum and respondents were not able to indicate clearcut criteria demarcating the boundaries of each segment. Moreover, most suppliers producing pet food of different quality categories do so on the same production lines with no or minor adjustments to the manufacturing process. Therefore, in line with its past decisions, in the present case the Commission assessed market shares for the supply of cat and dog food at wholesale level distinguishing between dry food, wet food and snacks and between branded and private label products."

        "text": "The Commission\u2019s past decisions concluded that the relevant geographic market is national in scope for branded products and larger than national (and possibly EEA-wide) for private label product at the wholesale level. This difference stems from the fact that private label products are not advertised by their supplier, as any advertising for private label products is done by the retailer. Producers may therefore afford higher transport costs and still offer the product at competitive prices compared to the branded pet food. Therefore, manufacturers of private label can competitively sell such products throughout an extensive area, which is wider than national. Moreover, some international hypermarket chains tend to carry out their procurement policies for private label purchases in a context which is wider than national. In the present case, the large majority of responding suppliers indicated that their European plants are able to deliver their branded and private label products in most of the EU territory and even to other continents. The large majority of responding retailers similarly indicated that they are able to procure branded and private label products from producers located in most of the European territory. In any event, the geographic market can be left open, because the transaction does not raise any concerns even under the most conservative approach (i.e. assuming a national scope of the relevant markets)."

The market investigation in the present case confirmed this conclusion. From the point of view of the upstream producers (which is particularly relevant in this case), the different distribution channels are seen to a large extent as interchangeable, because producers supply the same products across channels with no or minor adjustments. Suppliers also explained that they are able to shift volumes among different channels in response to changes in market demand. Also from the point of view of downstream consumers, grocery and specialist outlets are seen as competing against each other and consumers often buy products in both channels. The Commission\u2019s precedent (dating back to more than 20 years ago) did not mention sales on online platforms. The market investigation in the present case showed that customers easily switch between online and brick-and-mortar shops and suppliers increasingly pursue omni-channel strategies that span both online and offline sales. The Commission therefore considers that the overall market for the retail of pet food also includes online sales."

These agreements thus provide the legal basis for a global integration of the companies\u2019 networks and commercial policies. Furthermore, the scope of and rationale for these agreements go beyond the bundle of routes between Germany and their respective home countries.

According to the majority of both customers and suppliers MCC is not, or only to a limited extent substitutable for other excipients (such as lactose), as MCC has unique chemical properties and substitutes such as lactose are often not substitutes as there is a trend to providing lactose-free formulas. The market investigation also indicates that there may be a segmentation between MCC for pharmaceutical and MCC for nutraceutical applications. On the one hand, MCC for pharmaceuticals may have a price premium that makes it uneconomical to use it in nutraceuticals. On the other hand, MCC for nutraceuticals can only be used in pharmaceuticals if it complies with a pharmacopoeia such as the European pharmacopoeia. While the production process for both types of MCC is similar, there is a stronger emphasis on quality control and consistent quality for MCC for pharmaceutical applications. Thus, there may be limited substitutability between MCC for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, but the results of the market investigation are not entirely conclusive on this point, as the production process for all types of MCC is similar and there is an overlap of certain grades being used for both applications, which speaks in favour of not segmenting the market by end-application."

Further, the market investigation supports a possible further segmentation of the FCU market according to: (i) intended use (i.e., residential vs non-residential FCUs), (ii) based on the number of tubes (i.e., FCUs with two tubes and FCUs with four tubes) and (iii) design (i.e. classical FCUs that are free standing on the floor and non-classical FCUs that are mounted in the wall or ceiling).

Size and capacity of FCUs are the most cited distinguishing factors, with residential FCUs normally being smaller in size and having a lower heating/cooling capacity than non-residential FCUs. In terms of capacity, some respondent suggested that residential FCUs could be < 8kW and non-residential FCUs > 8kW. It was also mentioned that FCUs for residential use are \u2018quieter\u2019, \u2018thinner\u2019 and with better aesthetics (having excellent finishes and being made by metal sheets rather than plastic). Internal documents of the Parties appear to support a segmentation based on intended use. In addition, a due diligence report refers to a \u2018residential ventilation segment\u2019.

The Commission has considered further potential segmentations within non-carbonated soft drinks (namely fruit juices, energy and sport drinks), but has ultimately left this question open.

In the present case, the Commission considers that the exact product market definition can be left open. If dilutables were part of the wider market of soft drink (either carbonated or not, depending on the beverage mixed with the dilutable), no affected markets would arise in relation to these products.

Accordingly, a maximum of 12 daily slot pairs (i.e. the corresponding departure and arrival slots) are available for all the Relevant City Pairs considered together and within that overall limit, a maximum of five daily slot pairs are available for the Identified Long-haul City Pairs and for the London-Nice city pair.\n\nPursuant to Clause 1.1.2 of the Commitments, the number of daily Frequencies available to operate a service on the Identified City Pairs was increased from the original five daily Frequencies to seven daily Frequencies as the two slot pairs provided by IAG to Transaero were returned to IAG at the end of IATA Summer Season 2015. Therefore, at the beginning of the IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, 14 daily slot pairs were available, including seven daily slot pairs for the Identified City Pairs.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2016/2017, slot pairs were granted to Aeroflot to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2017, slot pairs were granted to Flybe Group Plc (\"Flybe\") for the operation of 25 weekly Frequencies (up to four daily Frequencies) on the London-Edinburgh route and 18 weekly Frequencies (up to three daily Frequencies) on the London-Aberdeen route. For IATA Summer Season 2018, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of one additional weekly Frequency on the London-Aberdeen route (on Sunday) and two additional weekly Frequencies on the London-Edinburgh route (one on Saturday and one on Sunday). Also for IATA Summer Season 2018, Aeroflot was awarded additional slot pairs to operate seven additional weekly Frequencies (one additional daily Frequency) on the London-Moscow route. For IATA Summer Season 2019, additional slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of seven weekly Frequencies (i.e. one daily Frequency) on the London-Edinburgh route. For IATA Summer Season 2020, the remaining slot pairs were granted to Flybe for the operation of four additional daily Frequencies on weekdays and on Sunday on the London-Edinburgh route and five additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Edinburgh route; and two additional Frequencies on Saturday on the London-Aberdeen route.\n\nTherefore, following the Summer 2020 Slot Award Decision, no Slots remained available under Clause 1.1.1(b) of the Commitments.\n\nFollowing Flybe\u2019s entry into administration on 5 March 2020, IAG (via British Airways) served notices to terminate its slot release agreements with Flybe on 5 March 2020 and clawed back the Slots that had been made available and were operated by Flybe pursuant to the Commitments. In total, IAG clawed back slots allowing 84 weekly frequencies.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, the Commission adopted a decision pursuant to Clause 1.3.3 of the Commitments granting Grandfathering rights to Flybe with respect to the Slots granted to it in the Flybe Summer 2017 Slot Award Decision (\"the Flybe 2017 Slots\"; concerning 43 weekly Frequencies).\n\nGiven that (i) a total of 98 weekly Frequencies are to be made available pursuant to Clauses 1.1.1 and 1.1.2; (ii) 14 weekly Frequencies were granted to Aeroflot; and (iii) Flybe has been granted Grandfathering rights with respect to 43 weekly Frequencies, 41 weekly Frequencies remained.\n\nFor IATA Winter Season 2021/2022, slot pairs were granted to Saudi Arabian Airlines (\"Saudia\") to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Riyadh route. For IATA Summer Season 2022, no Slots were released to applicant airlines. For IATA Winter Season 2022/2023 slot pairs were granted to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air France to operate seven weekly Frequencies (one daily Frequency) on the London-Nice route.\n\nTherefore, for IATA Summer Season 2023, 27 weekly Frequencies are still available under Clause 1.1.1."

        "text": "The relevant product market comprises scheduled passenger air transport services. The analysis focuses on city-pair markets for flights to and from London Heathrow airport (\"Heathrow\"), which is recognised as a highly slot-constrained airport. The Commission\u2019s assessment concentrates on the routes identified within the Commitments, specifically including London -Aberdeen, London -Edinburgh, London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow. The Commitments distinguish between \"Identified UK City Pairs\" (London -Aberdeen and London -Edinburgh) and broader \"Identified City Pairs\" (the latter including the UK pairs as well as London -Nice, London -Cairo, London -Riyadh, and London -Moscow). The geographic market is primarily defined narrowly, as flights operating to and from Heathrow only. This focus arises from the congestion and slot constraints at Heathrow, which is the central concern addressed by the Commitments. An analysis of wider markets, including London \"three\" (Heathrow, Gatwick, City) and London \"five\" airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, City, Luton, Stansted), was considered. However, the Commission\u2019s decision and remedies are aimed at addressing competition effects specifically at Heathrow, as highlighted in recital 58 of the Decision and in line with precedent decisions. The term \"London -Moscow\" is interpreted within the scope of the Commitments as Heathrow -Moscow, not encompassing Gatwick. While Gatwick services exist, they were not part of the competition concerns at the time of adoption of the Decision, and hence do not affect the scope of the committed slot releases. The Market Definition section therefore recognizes the relevant markets as scheduled passenger air transport services on the specified city-pairs operating out of Heathrow airport, on which the competitive dynamics and remedies are focused."
